It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]Surf the net and you'll find lots of stories about the best stocks to own. Some will be for the next year, five years, or even 10 years. Very few, however, will offer up ideas for the next half-century. In part, that's because investing today has become a \"What have you done for me lately?\" kind of business. Also, because so many companies have disappeared over the years, it's futile to guess who's going to stick around.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe average S&P; 500 company had a tenure of 33 years in 1965. In 1990, that dropped to 20 years. By 2026, it's forecast to fall to 14 years.  * 7 Great Biotech Stocks to Buy and Hold Now In other words, the odds of you winning the lottery is almost as good as owning a stock that remains publicly traded for 50 consecutive years. Nonetheless, I've decided to give myself this challenge. The 10 stocks to own on my list have very little debt, a market cap greater than $10 billion, and sector-wise provide a reasonably diversified portfolio. Linde (LIN)Source: Shutterstock Linde (NYSE:LIN), the UK-based supplier of industrial gases, gave back all of its 2019 gains and then some during the coronavirus slump, but looks solid otherwise. In fact, it's retesting its pre-pandemic levels already.In October 2018, Linde and U.S.-based Praxair completed their $90 billion merger of equals that created one the world's largest supplier of industrial gases with annual revenues of $28 billion and 80,000 employees around the world. The deal vaulted it ahead of Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY), the French provider of industrial gases. In the fourth quarter ending in December 2019, Linde had an operating profit of $.6 billion on revenue of $6.9 billion. Despite the $90 billion mergers, the company was able to sidestep the debt issue by doing an all-stock deal with Praxair. I would expect Linde to deliver double-digit annual returns for years to come.  Lululemon (LULU)Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU), the popular apparel brand that got its start making comfortable yoga pants for customers, has a bright future ahead.This isn't the first time I've included LULU stock in a list of long-term holds. In August 2016, I argued that LULU would be one of the 50 best-performing S&P; 500 stocks over the next decade. Three years in, it's living up to the promise.As Forbes contributor Sergei Klebnikov recently pointed out, Lululemon has benefited from selling directly to its customers through its own network of stores rather than selling its products wholesale to department stores and other third-party retailers.  * The 9 Best Cryptocurrencies to Watch for the Rest of 2020 Between its healthy women's business, a growing men's business, an eCommerce segment that's also rapidly growing, and its Asian stores selling its product like hotcakes, it's easy to understand why it's putting the rest of retail to shame.  Hormel (HRL)Source: calimedia / Shutterstock.com Hormel (NYSE:HRL) is a food company focused on protein-based products, including the Hormel, Spam, Dinty Moore and Skippy Brands. While its 2019 return wasn't Lululemon-like, it has delivered consistent returns for its shareholders. Over the past decade, it has generated an annualized total return of 18%. In its most recent earnings report, Hormel racked up $2.4 billion in revenues and re-affirmed its 2020 guidance.Hormel also paid an 11% dividend increase to 93 cents a share. That's the 54th consecutive year HRL has increased its dividend and the 11th consecutive year it has increased its dividend by 10% or more. It might not be the most exciting stock to own, but it surely is one of the most consistent.     CoStar Group (CSGP)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com If you're familiar with CoStar Group (NASDAQ:CSGP), you know there's money to be made with information. Specifically, CoStar makes money by providing the most comprehensive database of real estate information in the country. By being the best information provider around, CoStar shareholders did very well in 2019 with a total return of almost 75%. Over the past 15 years, CSGP has generated an annualized total return of 18.8%, double the total U.S. market. Last year, CoStar acquired STR Global, a data analytics company that specializes in hotel information, for $450 million. With only $64 million in annual revenue, CoStar expects to grow STR by 20% annually by helping bring products to the market faster.  * 7 Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for Post-Pandemic Gains As AI, machine learning, and data analytics become a regular part of business, expect CoStar to continue to grow at a considerable rate.   Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Source: michelmond / Shutterstock.com Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) manufactures the da Vinci robotic surgical system that allows doctors to carry out minimally invasive surgeries for patients around the world. It's installed almost 5,000 systems worldwide, with a majority sold to U.S. hospitals. However, the company's international sales are multiplying. The systems aren't cheap. That has allowed it to grow its revenues by 75% in the past four years. This has done wonders for ISRG stock, which has a nearly 22% total return year-to-date and 29.4% over the past 15 years. If there were a tech/healthcare stock that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) should have bought but didn't, ISRG would be it. The company has a reasonably wide moat but continues to invest in research and development so that it stays ahead of its competition. In 2016, it spent 8.9% of its revenue on R&D.; In 2020 it's projected to spend 11.6%, a 30% increase over four years. Owning ISRG over the long haul is a slam dunk. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN)Source: Shutterstock Biotech stocks, especially those developing clinical-stage drugs, scare the heck out of me. They don't make any money, but they spend several years and many millions or even billions getting the product approved.That's a lot of power riding in the hands of a small panel of experts. As a shareholder, you have very little control over the process. That's why it makes sense to invest in large biotech firms such as Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALXN), whose Soliris drug is used to prevent the breakdown of red blood cells in adults suffering from paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other related diseases. In the fourth quarter, Soliris increased worldwide sales by 11% more than the same period a year earlier.  * 7 Utility Stocks to Buy Keeping Lights On And Dividends Flowing Its successor drug, Ultomiris, is also doing well. As a result of this success, Alexion expects to make at least $10.25 per share in 2019 on a non-GAAP basis, significantly higher than its outlook at the beginning of the fiscal year. Up 15.7% year to date, expect bigger things from ALXN stock in 2020.  Cummins (CMI)Source: Lissandra Melo / Shutterstock.com I picked Cummins (NYSE:CMI) because it has one of the healthiest balance sheets of any large-cap company in the industrial goods sector. Currently, the company's total debt of $2.7 billion is just 40% of its book value. By comparison, Caterpillar's (NYSE:CAT) is 254% of its book value. In October, I recommended CMI stock as one of \"10 Stocks to Buy Regardless of Q3 Earnings.\" Although the maker of gas-powered generators doesn't expect much sales growth in 2019, its EBITDA margin is likely to be 16.5% or more. As a result, you can be sure that it will have plenty of cash in the future to pay its generous dividend.  Southwest Airlines (LUV)Source: Felipe_Sanchez / Shutterstock.com Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), which sells tickets at reasonable prices and tends to rely on Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft for its fleet, beat its peers over the past year by 795 basis points and 376 basis points over the past five years. There's no question things are really dicey in the airline industry right now but Southwest is in the kind of financial position to ride it out.In April 2018, I recommended Southwest stock over Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) because it's a better operator in tough economic times. While a recession in 2020 doesn't look likely, I don't see how any of the airline stocks hold a candle to Southwest.   * 4 Electric Car Stocks to Charge Your Portfolio It ought to be Warren Buffett's largest airline holding, but it's not. For Berkshire fans, that's a shame.     Alibaba Group (BABA)Source: Colin Hui / Shutterstock.com Jack Ma co-founded Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) in 1999. It wasn't easy getting China's largest e-commerce company up and running. Somehow, the former teacher managed to push through. Today, Ma is the wealthiest person in China, worth an estimated $44 billion. He's been so successful -- Alibaba's 2019 revenues were $56.2 billion with $12 billion in net income and $15.6 billion in free cash flow -- that he has stepped away from the business to focus all his efforts on his charitable foundation. Only 55, Ma has lots of causes to keep himself busy these days.Meanwhile, the company continues to expand into various businesses outside its e-commerce core. These include financial services and the cloud. And by no means are these businesses dalliances.    \"Alibaba first started its move into fintech in 2004 with the launch of AliPay.

Using TipRanks\u2019 database, which features extensive market data collated in real time, we\u2019ve pulled up the details on three great stock market values. All three of these stocks offer investors a solid package: a one-year upside potential of at least 10%, a dividend over 2%, and a history of long-term share appreciation. While all three are down in the current market cycle, Wall Street\u2019s analyst corps sees each of them as a Strong Buy. Even the economic shutdowns, which forced so many companies into losses for Q1, couldn\u2019t derail these three \u2013 each showed profits in the quarter, and beat the earnings forecasts. Let\u2019s dive into the details, and find out what makes these three stocks so valuable. Procter & Gamble Company (PG)\u00a0We\u2019ll start with one of the blue-chip staples of the Dow Jones average. Procter & Gamble showed steady earnings growth through 2019, beating estimates in every quarter, before recording a sharp drop in Q1. That drop, however, needs to be put into context \u2013 the company\u2019s calendar first quarter is historically its lowest of the year. Not to mention Q1 2020 reflected both a fifth consecutive earnings beat and a modest year-over-year gain of 4.4%, despite the economic shutdowns.\u00a0In an odd way, the coronavirus crisis may have even helped PG \u2013 the company\u2019s strong presence in the home & consumer health, personal care, and hygiene niches meant that demand for PG products remained strong, even as overall consumer activity declined. In the company\u2019s Q1 earnings release (PG\u2019s fiscal Q3), the company reported 4.2% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition to its solid position in the current environment, Procter & Gamble is also one of the market\u2019s true dividend champs. The company has a 16-year history of steady dividend growth and reliable payments. The current payment is 79 cents, the company raised it by 4 cents in Q1, annualizing to $3.16 per quarter and giving a yield of 2.7%. While that is only slightly higher than the consumer goods sector average of 2.5%, Procter\u2019s dividend is backed by that long history \u2013 and it has a payout ratio of 64%, indicating that the payment is easily sustainable with current income levels. Covering PG stock for Evercore ISI, Robert Ottenstein headlines his note \u201cBetter, More Resilient, Wiser.\u201d As for forward prospects, Ottenstein writes, \u201cWe see Procter as a reliable 6-8% EPS grower, as underscored by the firm\u2019s confidence to raise the dividend by 6% in the face of unprecedented challenges\u2026\u201d Ottenstein keeps his Buy rating on PG shares, and raises his price target from $130 to $140. This implies 21% upside potential for the stock in the coming 12 months. (To watch Ottenstein\u2019s track record, click here) Overall, PG\u2019s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 10 reviews, which include 9 Buys against a single Hold. Wall Street is slightly less aggressive here than Ottenstein, but the $133 average price target still suggests an upside potential of 15%. (See Procter & Gamble stock analysis on TipRanks) Linde PLC (LIN)\u00a0Next up is Linde, an important player in the industrial gas industry. This is not a consumer utility; rather, Linde dominates the market for pure gasses such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and argon, along with compound gasses such as carbon monoxide. All have important uses in industry, especially within the medical and HVAC sectors \u2013 which have been deemed essential even during the public health crisis. Like PG above, Linde has a secure niche and product line-up despite the recessionary pressures. The quality of Linde\u2019s market position is demonstrated by the quarterly performance. Where most companies registered declines or even losses, Linde reported Q1 EPS level with Q4. At $1.89, the quarterly earnings beat the forecast by 3.2%, and was the fifth quarter in a row to top the estimates. In another similarity to PG, Linde\u2019s continued profitability is directly related to its strong presence in the healthcare industry. Some 20% of company revenues come from sales in the medical field (oxygen, for example, is a vital item in treating respiratory ailments), and Linde has been able to successfully absorb losses in other segments. With revenues secure, Linde was not shy about declaring its dividend going forward. The company announced that it will pay out 96 cents per share in Q2. That annualizes to $3.85, and gives a yield almost exactly at the S&P; average: 2%. Michael Sison, 5-star analyst with Well Fargo, makes the simple case for LIN shares, \u201c[We] believe this stable cash flow business and strong balance sheet make LIN an attractive story in the current uncertain environment.  We also view LIN as a growth story, with the $9.5B project backlog as the pipeline for future earnings growth.  Finally, we continue to expect the company to deliver on additional merger cost and revenue synergies once the recovery starts to take shape, likely before 2021.\u201d To this end, Sison puts a $235 price target on the stock, showing his confidence in a 16% one-year upside potential. With this positive outlook, Sison rates the stock a Buy. (To watch Sison\u2019s track record, click here) LIN is another stock with a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares have 22 reviews on record, breaking down into 17 Buys and 5 Holds. The current trading price is $202.34, and the average price target of $216 implies room for 7% growth this year. (See Linde stock analysis on TipRanks) Raytheon Technologies (RTX)\u00a0Last on our list is Raytheon, a staple in the aerospace and defense industries, as well as a major contractor for the Pentagon. Raytheon\u2019s better-known products include radars for the Air Force\u2019s front line fighter aircraft and many of the military\u2019s front line air-to-air and air-to-surface guided missiles.  No one ever went broke selling weapons, and Raytheon is a good example of that old saw. The company\u2019s $1.78 Q1 EPS was 60% higher than the estimates. Even more impressive, it was the eighth quarter in a row that RTX beat the earnings estimates. The solid EPS was derived from $18.2 billion in revenues, a figure in-line with both the estimates and the year-ago figure. Raytheon management declared a 47.5 cent quarterly dividend, to be paid out in June. In deference to the difficult economic times, and the possibility of reduced defense contracts as budgets contract, this dividend was a sharp decline from the 74 cents paid out in Q4. The important point for investors, however, is that Raytheon remains committed to maintaining its dividend, with the yield at 2.8%, which is above the industrial goods sector average of 2%. In his note on RTX for Credit Suisse, 5-star analyst Robert Spingarn states, \u201c[We] assume that RTX defense can sustain a 2019-2022 sales CAGR of 6%+ (consistent with its record backlog), and that improving trends for defense margins, working capital, and capex can offset pension headwinds, then RTX defense likely stands to generate ~$5.3 billion of FCF in 2022\u2026\u201d This solid outlook contributes to his Buy rating and $81 price target on the stock. At current prices, this target implies a 26% potential upside to RTX. (To watch Spingarn\u2019s track record, click here)\u00a0With a share price of $64.52, and an average price target of $75.25, RTX boasts a 17% upside potential for the next 12 months. The consensus on the Street here is a Strong Buy, with 11 Buy reviews and 3 Holds.
