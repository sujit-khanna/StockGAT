South Korea-based Hanmi will receive an upfront payment of $10 million and will receive milestone payments of up to $860 million conditional on the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of efinopegdutide. In addition, Hanmi will be eligible to get double-digit royalties on sales of approved product and retain an option to commercialize efinopegdutide in Korea.\u201cData from phase 2 studies has provided compelling clinical evidence that warrants further evaluation of efinopegdutide for the treatment of NASH,\u201d said Merck\u2019s Sam Engel. \u201cWe continue to build on our proud legacy of developing meaningful medicines for the treatment of metabolic diseases and look forward to advancing this candidate.\u201dEfinopegdutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist, which activates both the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors. The safety and efficacy of efinopegdutide has previously been evaluated in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, including for the treatment of severely obese individuals with and without type 2 diabetes.Merck shares are currently trading down more than 9% year-to-date, while analysts have a cautiously optimistic\u00a0Moderate Buy\u00a0consensus on the stock. That breaks down into 5 Buy ratings versus 3 Hold ratings. Meanwhile, the average analyst price target of $93.20 implies 13% upside potential in the coming year.Goldman Sachs analyst \u00a0Terence Flynn this week raised the stock\u2019s rating to Buy from Hold with a price target of $105 (27% upside potential), up from $91, saying that the market \u201cseems to be underappreciating a potential opportunity of between $13 billion and $18 billion in pipeline assets\u201d.Flynn sees the stock's risk/reward as attractive in view of a list of upcoming readouts later this year and into next for cancer, HIV and COVID-19. The analyst noted that Merck also has $45 billion of \"firepower\" for potential acquisitions or business development after halting its share repurchase program this year.

But this news is a bit different. In fact, it's the exact opposite of what you'd ordinarily expect.Nabriva Therapeutics (NBRV), a microcap biotech based in Dublin, Ireland, announced Thursday that it will partner up with American Big Pharma giant Merck (MRK) to market Merck's \"SIVEXTRO\" antibiotic for treating acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by Gram-positive pathogens (bacteria that produce a crystal violet\u00a0stain\u00a0result when subjected to the Gram stain test).SIVEXTRO is used to treat such common conditions as abscesses, cellulitis, and wound infections often caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.Merck owns the rights to SIVEXTRO, originally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014. Nabriva will be buying SIVEXTRO produced by Merck \"at specified prices\" -- with no upfront payment due to Merck -- then turning around and marketing, selling, and distributing the drug to its U.S. customers with \"commercial and sales services\" assistance from privately-held Amplity Health. The agreement gives Nabriva these rights initially through the end of 2023 (sales are expected to begin on January 1, 2021). Absent cancellation by either party, the agreement will automatically renew for three-year-long extensions following that initial period.Northland analyst Carl Byrnes explained the significance of this development for Nabriva in a \"flash note\" issued shortly after the announcement.In essence then, the significance of this deal is this: Nabriva is obtaining the right to buy and resell a commonly used antibiotic, incurring no costs to develop it, no upfront cost to acquire its rights, and Nabriva can enjoy whatever profit margin it is able to build into the difference between the prices it pays Merck to buy the drug, and the prices it can convince its customers to pay. Nabriva doesn't even incur much in the way of fixed costs, as its agreement with Amplity will be both \"flexible and scalable.\" (Merck, for its part, gets a bigger market for the drug without making any independent efforts of its own).Byrnes believes that Nabriva is getting the better part of this deal, as it could, in combination with the company's other drugs, significantly boost Nabriva's currently tiny revenue stream of only $8.6 million in annual sales. Indeed, in the analyst's estimation, the first year of this agreement being in effect could see Nabriva's sales jump 16%, to $10 million -- and sales could more than double the next year, to $25 million.Accordingly, Byrnes is reiterating his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Nabriva stock, with a $1.50 price target that implies nearly 60% upside from the stock's current $0.91 share price. (To watch Byrnes' track record, click here)Not all analysts on the street voice Byrnes' bullish forecast for Nabriva. Overall, based on 3 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 2 other analysts recommend investors to stay sidelined.

It does not stimulate or heat tissue and causes minimal damage to healthy cells.The two companies plan to conduct a phase 2 pilot study of Tumor Treating Fields concomitant with Keytruda for first-line treatment of intrathoracic advanced or metastatic, PD-L1 positive NSCLC. The study is designed to enroll approximately 66 patients in\u00a0the United States\u00a0and is expected to begin in the second half of 2020.Objective response rate (ORR) is the primary endpoint of the study. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, progression free survival (PFS), PFS at six months, one-year survival rate, duration of response, disease control rate at 18 weeks and safety.\u201cWe are very pleased to collaborate with MSD, a global leader in oncology, in this important combination study as we strive to extend survival in some of the most aggressive forms of cancer through the development and commercialization of Tumor Treating Fields,\u201d said\u00a0William Doyle, Novocure\u2019s Executive Chairman.\u201cMultiple preclinical studies suggest that the use of Tumor Treating Fields together with anti-PD-1 therapy can potentially augment the immune response resulting in improved tumor control\u201d he added.Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 85% of all cases. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the\u00a0US\u00a0with NSCLC is approximately 24%.Tumor Treating Fields is approved in certain countries for the treatment of adults with glioblastoma and in the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0for mesothelioma, two of the most difficult cancer types to treat. The therapy shows promise in multiple solid tumor types \u2013 including some of the most aggressive forms of cancer.Shares in Merck are trading down 14% year-to-date, while Novocure has plunged over 30%. Analysts have a cautiously optimistic outlook on Merck with a\u00a0Moderate Buy\u00a0consensus and $91 average analyst price target (17% upside potential). (See Merck stock analysis on TipRanks).\u201cOur investment thesis on Merck is that Keytruda will remain the key growth driver for the business over the next several years, with other declining business segments continuing to throw off steady cash with which it can do strategic early-stage deals to augment its pipeline and diversify the business longer term\u201d comments RBC Capital\u2019s\u00a0Randall Stanicky.
