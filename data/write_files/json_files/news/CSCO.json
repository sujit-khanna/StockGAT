Even though, India's caste system was officially abolished in 1950, the 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life.The lawsuit alleges that the engineer was expected to accept a caste hierarchy within the workplace where he held the lowest status within the team and, as a result, received less pay, fewer opportunities, and other inferior terms and conditions of employment, and when the engineer opposed the treatment, they allegedly retaliated against him by reducing his role on the team, isolating him from colleagues and giving him assignments that were impossible to complete under the circumstances.

It can be a well-planned circus-like event for many publicly traded companies and no matter the size or history with Wall Street. But in the aftermath of those thrills and chills, there are sometimes stronger opportunities to buy or sell short a more certain outcome as we'll explore in three Dow Jones stocks to trade right now.Amid the uncertainty of the novel coronavirus pandemic, political saber rattling abroad with China and an ever closer Presidential Election, one constant investors can be confident of is earnings season and its organized queue of corporate confessionals. How a quarterly report plays out is another matter entirely.Thus far, Q2 reports have turned in a beat rate of 76% with just over 1,500 companies topping estimates. Nearly 500 companies have also missed views. Headline results are also just the tip of the iceberg. What was the size of the beat or miss? How did it compare to the whisper number? What about sales or the company's outlook? How did investors react to the report?InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIt's a lot to swallow. As such, it's easy to see why the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its cadre of influential blue-chips are so popular in gauging the pulse of the market and the economy at large. But the venerable barometer is 30 stocks. It's important to remember companies other than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) whose trillion-dollar plus increasingly influence the market bellwether, aren't the end all, say all for investors.  * 7 Semiconductor Stocks Worth Buying as Technology Accelerates These three Dow Jones stocks in particular stand out:  * Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  * Chevron (NYSE:CVX)  * Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)Let's look at what's happening to each of these stocks that makes them worth a look today. Dow Jones Stocks to Trade: Cisco Systems (CSCO)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCisco Systems announced its results Wednesday evening. A profit beat of 6 cents on earnings of 80 cents was easily swept under the carpet in favor of a weakening revenue trend compounded by management's sales warning for the upcoming fourth quarter.Technically, a bearish drop just over 11% has provided pattern confirmation for a downward-sloping resistance line seen on the provided monthly chart. The price action also marked a second breach of a steeper uptrend dating back to 2016 and shares are now signaling a bearish stochastics crossover.The observation is Cisco could revisit its March bottom and Fibonacci zone support from roughly $28 - $33 before all is said and done. The October $40 / $37.5 put spread priced for 55 cents is a favored way to gain limited and reduced bearish exposure to CSCO stock. Chevron (CVX)  Source: Charts by TradingViewCVX joins the other standout Dow Jones stocks to trade after the company reported a worse-than-forecast loss of $8.3 billion and much weaker than expected sales of $13.49. Could it get any worse for the energy giant? Maybe.Reduced guidance from Chevron's management tied to a still challenging Covid-19 driven operating environment suggests that the company isn't out of the woods. But investors have managed, albeit ever so modestly, to see things differently in a bullish sort of way.Technically, and in the wake of the report, CVX stock rallied just enough to narrowly confirm a corrective pullback of 21%.Admittedly, it's easier to appreciate a more visible bearish topping candle put together in June and bearish price action in 2020, which overall has a rather slippery look to it. But it's fair to say and see there's been a lot of deep technical testing supportive of being upbeat, like only a contrarian can be.  * 7 of the Smartest ETFs to Buy Right Now Unlike management's warning to Wall Street, I'd simply urge investors to use a collar strategy for stronger risk-adjusted positioning in this Dow Jones stock to trade. Intel (INTC)  Source: Charts by TradingViewIntel, the world's largest semiconductor company by revenues, topped profit and sales views roughly three weeks ago. But a six-month delay for its 7-nanometer chips has put the company further behind competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). This led INTC stock investors to drive the stock down 16.24%.Now, INTC stock is stationed at what should prove a major inflection point. On the one hand, shares have confirmed a weekly chart test its former highs from 2000. Stochastics is also on the cusp of a bullish stochastics crossover within oversold territory. Furthermore, shares remain positioned above the chart's 2015 and 2009 uptrend lines.Alternatively, a failure to hold this week's inside doji pattern low could be the beginning of a larger correction, where both trend-lines are at risk. With Intel facing company-specific problems on top of more universal Covid-19 issues, I'd say buying a weekly bottom has technical grounds. However, accumulating on weakness is another matter.For the time being, a long Sept $50 / $52.50 call vertical for 75 cents looks like an acceptable risk-to-reward trade-off for bullish investors.Chris Tyler is a former floor-based, derivatives market maker on the American and Pacific exchanges.

During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation.Not all technology stocks are treated equally. While the major companies have led the market off the March lows, much of old tech has stumbled. Another example of this is the price action in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), which is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.All-Time Highs - What Are you Talking About? When looking at the long-term relative performance of Cicso since late 2000, it's horrible. Of course, it took many years for many technologies to recover and make new all-time highs, but Cisco hasn't even come close.From its peak in September of 2000 at $69.63, the best it could do was reach $58.26 in July 2019 and now is quite some distance from that level.Always Beats And Then Gets The Beats: Gong back to the first quarter of 2011, the company has beat for EPS in all but two quarters. It's similar for sales, with only one miss over the same period of time.View more earnings on CSCOOn a few occasions, the issue has rallied, but on most, it has been slammed, certainly not a good sign when it has met or exceeded estimates, which is reflected in its share price. The fickle finger of Wall Street always seems to find something it doesn't like in the report.The Song Remains The Same: After the close on Wednesday, the company announced a fourth-quarter EPS beat of 6 cents along with a sales beat of $434 million. However, the Street is more focused on its lower guidance for Q1, which fell well shy of Street estimates, and sales to be down around 10% year over year.After-Hours Price Action: Traders that chased the headline number got smoked as the issue immediately cleared the major resistance at the $48 area, reaching $48.50 and sharply reversing course. In a matter of minutes, it saw major step-down sellers to the $45 area. It ended the after-hours session at $44.99.Price Action When Being Covered On The Show: When the issue was being discussed on the show, it was trading at $44.80. Co-host Dennis Dick lamented about having this \"dog\" in his portfolio, which the author of this article also owns.\"It is a perennial underperformed,\" Dick said. \"I have it in my portfolio and I wish hadn't... Growth is not there [and] they are looking to cut expenses.\"The author of this article mentioned it was not bouncing at all and the host agreed it could do what Intel did after its report.Price Action In The Regular Session: It's $4 lower open has turned to be pennies off the high for the session, which is $43.84. Sellers have engulfed the issue and the current low for the days stands at $42.38 as of 12 p.m. ET. If the decline continues, it's next level of support doesn't come in until the trio of daily lows at the $41 area from early May.See more from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Moderna  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: American Airlines  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Simon Property Group(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Initial jobless claims last week totaled 963,000, the government said. That's the first time they've been under one million since this crisis began. The number was down a decent amount from the 1.1 million that analysts had been expecting, and might provide more indication that the economy continues to recover. That said, any figure this high would be historically huge in normal times, so we still have a long way to go.Stock indices had been under pressure in pre-market trading ahead of the data but began to trim losses once the number hit the tape. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) sits just below the all-time record high of 3393 and the all-time record close of 3386. Aside from claims, investors might keep an eye on Washington today, where politicians continue to haggle over a possible new stimulus package. If this sounds like a broken record, well, it's been going on for a couple weeks now. Progress looks thin, judging from this morning's media reports. Not much changed overnight, aside from Cisco (CSCO) shares getting beaten up after the company issued a disappointing outlook (see more below). The CSCO weakness might weigh a bit on the Nasdaq (COMP) today. Other than that, jobless claims remain the key story this morning. Crude is unchanged and bonds are down a tick. Overseas, Wednesday brought some tough news for Anglophiles as the British economy plunged into a deep recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) fell more than 20% in Q2, official data showed. The stock market there dropped 1% Thursday, with shares down across Europe, too. Asia did better, but the Shanghai market has been leveling off after last month's huge rally.Like Deja Vu All Over Again To continue yesterday's baseball analogy, the market always seems to throw a curveball when investors expect a fastball. It definitely felt that way Wednesday. Going into the session, the dominant talk both online and on the news was about a possible rotation out of Tech and into value and cyclical sectors. Then Tech stepped up after the opening bell and left everyone else in its wake. Well, maybe that's an exaggeration. Tech did recover a lot of its losses, helped by Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and the semiconductor stocks regaining their footing, but the other sectors didn't do badly, either. Instead, Wall Street enjoyed an old-fashioned broad-based rally that carried across most of the key parameters. Nearly every S&P 500 sector climbed 1% or more. So-called \"defensives,\" cyclicals like Energy, bond proxies...you name the sector, it was on the rise. By Wednesday's close, the SPX was right up near its all-time record high close of 3386 posted back in February before you-know-what dominated the headlines. For the record, this has been one very quick comeback from the sudden bear market that occurred in March. If the SPX does set a record high in the coming days, it would shatter the old record of 310 trading days between the previous bull market high and the next bull market high. That record was set in 1967, Barron's noted. As of Wednesday, it's been just 122 trading days since the last bull market high. Yes, folks, we're in a new bull market. That bear market didn't last long, did it? In one exception to the general exuberance Wednesday, Financials lost ground after a strong 10-year auction. This suggests demand for government debt remains elevated, which could ultimately keep a lid on rates. As we've been noting, Financials really face a tough headwind thanks mostly to weak profit outlooks weighed on by low rates. That said, the 10-year yield is sitting above 0.67%, up from lows near 0.5% a week ago. Another cautionary note beyond the Financial pain is that trading volume continues to be lighter than average, possibly a seasonal effect, with some people perhaps taking whatever passes for a vacation these days. Wednesday's rally came despite the two sides in Washington remaining far apart on a stimulus. There hasn't been much headway on this key issue, but the market has been resilient despite that. Maybe to some extent people are assuming it will eventually happen, which means we might see some \"sell the fact\" pressure if Congress and the White House get together on something. We'll have to wait and see.Don't Forget Key Reason for Rally If nothing else, Wednesday's action shows why some analysts say stocks might continue to be strong despite valuation concerns. One reason for this is the Fed.Unlike, say, in 2016 when rates were at all-time lows and stocks were setting new highs, there isn't that background alarm that the Fed might step in at any time and end the party. That's arguably exactly what the Fed did in 2017-2018 as it raised rates on a regular basis before the market took a beating in Q4 2018. This time, with the pandemic still raging, unemployment in double digits, and economic growth far weaker than even during the slow-growth period of late 2015/early 2016, the Fed has basically committed to keeping its foot off the brake. This can be helpful for all sectors, including defensive ones like Utilities and Staples that tend to do better when rates are low. While the average S&P 500 yield is now back down to around 1.8% from above 2% at the peak of the pandemic selloff, it's still very high vs. the 0.67% yield of 10-year Treasuries. This tends to push many investors into stocks from fixed income. At the same time, the low interest rates can help companies that need to borrow (think Energy). They also can help the housing market, automobile makers, and other manufacturers of big-ticket items by generating more consumer interest as people look to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Only banks truly miss the rate party, but they'd arguably benefit if housing remains firm.And Remember Why Caution Lingers All this doesn't mean the stock market goes straight up or even continues to rally at all. There are a bunch of bearish arguments you could make against stocks right now, mostly having to do with pressure from the China trade dispute, valuations, worries about whether consumers can keep spending if a second stimulus doesn't come around, and, most obviously, the incredible amount of uncertainty about the pandemic. Gold is down the last two days, but it's still above $1,900 an ounce, which shows the caution out there. There's also the election looming less than three months away. That could create more volatility and help steer various sectors in certain directions if one party or the other appears to be pulling away. Though past isn't precedent, defense contractor and big pharma shares have often come under pressure historically when Democrats shine in the polls, while education and alternative energy shares can suffer when Republicans look more likely to be victorious. We'll obviously be talking more about election-related matters as the voting gets closer.All these worries could lead to some potential hedging as investors now see the market back at February levels where it was before the crisis. Arguably, the SPX is a lot more expensive now than it was then, because earnings expectations have come down so far. On that note, Q2 earnings are looking better than analysts had expected but still pretty awful by any historic standards. S&P 500 earnings likely fell 35.2% in Q2, research firm CFRA said Wednesday, which beat its initial pre-earnings estimate for a 45.7% decline. For all of 2020, the firm now sees EPS falling 21.8% vs. the initial estimate of 24.8%, followed by 27.4% earnings growth anticipated in 2021. From a technical standpoint, resistance is seen at the old SPX high of 3393, with support seen between a range of 3212 and 3259, CFRA wrote. The SPX briefly traded above the record closing high of 3386 yesterday but couldn't hold that level.The bias, CFRA said, remains bullish. Still, these kinds of quick recoveries historically are often followed by pullbacks, the firm added. With that in mind, it wouldn't be too shocking to see a drop of 5% to 10% for the SPX at some time in the few months, though history isn't guaranteed to repeat.  CHART OF THE DAY:  BREAK IN THE PATTERN? For weeks, the dollar index ($DXY--candlestick) had been steadily falling while gold (/GC--purple line) soared to new all-time highs. This week changed that, but whether it's a temporary or more permanent shift remains to be seen. As long as economic data continue to show the U.S. economy recovering, that could keep pressure on gold and provide support for the dollar. Data sources: CME Group, Intercontinental Exchange.

Cisco, Lyft Fall After Earnings: The latest earnings news came late Wednesday from Cisco Systems, Inc.  (NASDAQ: CSCO), which beat on earnings and revenue but saw shares get slammed nearly 7%  in pre-market trading after issuing disappointing guidance. It sees fiscal Q1 earnings per share below the Street's estimates and sales down 9% to 11% year over year. Not pretty. Investors generally gave companies a break when they pulled guidance earlier this year, but now seem to be back to punishing firms that disappoint with weak forecasts. With CSCO, the guidance miss is actually a bit concerning because usually they're pretty good at figuring out what's going on and how it might affect their financials. The pandemic might be throwing a lot of companies into confusion. Lyft, Inc. (NASDAQ: LYFT) shares fell nearly 2% in pre-market trading after the company reported a 61% drop in revenue for Q2 as the pandemic limited demand. Lyft said active riders dropped 60% from a year ago.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thursday-claims-day-claims-fall-135122370.html"}, {"symbol": "CSCO", "publishedDate": "2020-08-13 13:49:04", "title": "Cisco Tumbles After Weak Forecast Shows Recession Biting", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Cisco Systems Inc. shares tumbled Thursday after the company gave a lackluster sales forecast, signaling that businesses are spending less in the pandemic-driven recession.Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins pledged to reduce expenses by $1 billion through a reorganization that will include job cuts and early retirement for some workers. The plan will cost about $900 million, which will include severance and other \u201ctermination benefits,\u201d the company said in a regulatory filing. Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer is also leaving.Revenue will fall 9% to 11% from a year earlier in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in late October, the San Jose, California-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts on average had projected a decline of about 7%. Adjusted profit will be 69 cents to 71 cents a share, lower than Wall Street expectations of 76 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Cisco shares fell 11% to $42.88 in trading Thursday in New York.Analysts were broadly disappointed by the news, with Cowen writing that the results and outlook \u201cwere at best uninspiring and at worst raise some concern.\u201d However, the longer-term view was more positive. Multiple firms cited Cisco\u2019s dividend and valuation as factors that would limit much additional downside risk, and the narrative in 2021 \u201ccould get materially better,\u201d according to Evercore ISI.A large chunk of Cisco\u2019s revenue comes from government agencies, small and medium-sized businesses and providers of internet and online video services. While some larger companies are still spending, many smaller customers have cut spending to adjust to an economic slowdown sparked by Covid-19 lockdowns.In Cisco\u2019s Americas region, where sales dropped 12%, demand hasn\u2019t improved in the last 90 days and the U.S. needs Congress to provide another stimulus package, Robbins said in an interview.\u201cAs you move down the customer stack, things just get weaker and weaker as the customers get smaller and smaller because they just don\u2019t have the financial wherewithal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country is still driven by small and medium-sized business for hiring and everything else. I\u2019m concerned about what happens next.\u201dRobbins said that optimism about a rebound in tech company earnings has been stoked by consumer demand in certain areas. But major investments in corporate infrastructure will require more evidence of an improving economy, he cautioned.Robbins is trying to reduce Cisco\u2019s reliance on expensive proprietary hardware and increase sales of software and services. After returning to growth in 2018, revenue has started to decline again this year, showing how Cisco\u2019s business is still exposed to economic cycles.Cisco said net income in the fiscal fourth-quarter rose to $2.6 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $12.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 80 cents a share. Analysts were looking for profit of 74 cents on revenue of $12.1 billion.Infrastructure platforms, its hardware business and main source of revenue, suffered a 16% sales drop to $6.6 billion. Applications, the software business, saw revenue fall 9%, while security-related sales increased 10%.(Updates share price in fourth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-tumbles-weak-forecast-shows-121928931.html"}, {"symbol": "CSCO", "publishedDate": "2020-08-13 13:45:00", "title": "Dow&#39;s 70-point drop led by losses in Cisco, Walgreens Boots stocks", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "DOW UPDATE Behind declines for shares of Cisco and Walgreens Boots, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down Thursday morning.

(NASDAQ: CSCO) fell by 0.93%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Cisco Systems has.Cisco Systems's Debt Based on Cisco Systems's financial statement as of May 18, 2020, long-term debt is at $11.58 billion and current debt is at $4.51 billion, amounting to $16.08 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $10.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $5.72 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Cisco Systems has $91.39 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives.However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Recap: Cisco Systems Q4 Earnings  * Understanding Cisco Systems's Unusual Options Activity  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company expects adjusted earnings of 69 cents to 71 cents per share, which is below analysts\u2019 estimates of 76 cents.\u201cThe pandemic has had the most impact on our enterprise and commercial orders, driven by an overall slowdown in spending. We are seeing customers continue to delay their purchasing decisions in certain areas while increasing spend in others until they have greater visibility and clarity on the timing and shape of the global economic recovery,\u201d said Cisco CEO Charles Robbins. \u201cDespite this challenging economic environment, the pandemic has also triggered a massive and rapid shift to remote operations and automation to maximize personal safety.\u201dRobbins disclosed that Cisco plans to cut costs by $1 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters.For the fiscal fourth quarter, sales declined 9.5% to $12.15 billion year-on-year, topping estimates of $12.08 billion, as the work-at-home shift drove demand for Cisco\u2019s web security and virtual networking products. In the quarter ended July 25, the company earned an adjusted 80 cents per share in the quarter, exceeding estimates of 74 cents. \"We executed well in Q4, delivering strong margins despite the very challenging environment,\" said Cisco CFO Kelly Kramer. \"Software subscriptions now make up 78% of our software revenue and remaining performance obligations continued to grow strongly in the quarter, reflecting the strength of our portfolio of software and services.\u201dIn addition, Cisco announced that Kramer will retire from the company once a replacement is found.Following the earnings results, five-star analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver at Robert W. Baird lowered the stock\u2019s price target to $46 from $48 and maintained a Hold rating saying that he expects overall Cisco growth to remain under pressure as macro headwinds persist.

After returning to growth in 2018, revenue has started to decline again this year, showing how Cisco\u2019s business is still exposed to economic cycles.Cisco said net income in the fiscal fourth-quarter rose to $2.6 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $12.2 billion. Excluding certain items, Cisco posted profit of 80 cents a share.

The stock price moved up to $47.83 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $50.00  * Volume: 5042  * Open Interest: 300163 Indications of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.\"Out of the money\" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. \"Out of the money\" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Morning Market Stats in 5 Minutes  * Earnings Scheduled For August 12, 2020  * Earnings Preview for Cisco Systems(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
