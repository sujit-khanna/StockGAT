Sales dropped to $10.99 billion, a 1.36% decrease between quarters. In Q2, Accenture brought in $11.14 billion in sales but only earned $1.49 billion.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Accenture posted an ROCE of 0.1%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on ACNROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Accenture is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Accenture, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies.Q3 Earnings Insight Accenture reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.9/share, which beat analyst predictions of $1.85/share.See more from Benzinga  * Price Over Earnings Overview: Accenture  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

It's a major commercial thoroughfare, home to dozens of black-owned businesses. It's also eight blocks from where George Floyd suffocated beneath a police officer's knee and died on May 25. During the chaos that followed, dozens of Lake Street's buildings and businesses burned.It was a serious blow to a community that's struggled for decades to achieve economic equality. In 2018, the median income for black households in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area was $38,200; for whites, it was $82,500. That\u2019s a wider gap than for the U.S. as a whole, despite the area\u2019s progressive reputation, a corporate community that's renowned for its civic-mindedness, and a robust regional economy.Worse, it echoes a range of other depressing metrics \u2014 including gaps in employment, wages, education and business ownership \u2014 that make the Twin Cities one of the most unequal metro areas in the country. In some ways, these are very much local problems. But they also exemplify some broader long-term trends that have contributed to the current national crisis.As I surveyed the damage, two questions in particular were bothering me. Why is Minneapolis's black unemployment rate more than four times that for whites? And why, in an area\u00a0where corporations make such conspicuous efforts to support diversity, do black-owned businesses make up such a small part of the local economy?*****Later that morning, I met up with Tawanna Black, an experienced business and philanthropy executive, in downtown St. Paul. In 2018, Black founded the Center for Economic Inclusion, which works to combat racism and inequality across the Twin Cities. With clients and partners such as Accenture Inc., the Itasca Project, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Ramsey County (home to St. Paul), the group calculates metrics and indicators for inclusion and seeks to deploy them across the region.We talked about the factors that drive economic inequality in the Twin Cities and beyond, and in particular how corporate America can do its part to reduce disparities in employment and ensure that black communities share in the nation\u2019s prosperity.Many of the problems, Black pointed out, were decades in the making. Beginning in the early 20th century, racial covenants prevented black residents from purchasing homes, accessing good schools and accumulating wealth in Minnesota and elsewhere. Progress has been made on some of these fronts: In the Twin Cities, at least, more equitable zoning policies are helping to ameliorate inequalities over time.But there remain many less obvious problems that contributed to the pain and anger that have erupted since Floyd\u2019s death.To take one example, the considerable corporate philanthropic efforts that the area is known for sometimes allow executives to punt on the harder question of addressing inequalities in their own organizations. Meanwhile, the Twin Cities \u2014 like a lot of communities across the U.S. \u2014 are increasingly home to large employers that don't deal directly with consumers, and thus are less responsive to community complaints and campaigns.It adds up to a lack of accountability.\"I've heard some business leaders say we need somebody to give us the right proposal and ask the right question,\" Black told me. \u201cI wrestle with that because I think the state of racial inequities is hurting everyone. In a city this size, this prosperous, we should be producing results. And if we're not, we should be asking ourselves, what does it take? And we haven't gotten to that point where it's not just a thing for \u2018you people\u2019 to go solve \u2014 as in people of color.\u201d*****Changing that mindset won\u2019t be easy,\u00a0because many of the underlying problems are structural \u2014 held in place by either government policy, strong corporate incentives or some combination.Black points to low-income workers who lose government benefits when they reach a certain wage level. This sometimes forces them to choose between health care and a job, and makes it harder for employers to retain minority workers, a decades-old problem. \"More and more I find HR leaders and employers that want to work with government to change those systems,\" Black told me, but getting the political system to respond can be a huge challenge.Another example involves contracts. Corporate America is often willing to fund organizations that train minority entrepreneurs, Black said, but when it comes to actually hiring them, those companies sometimes\u00a0beg out \"because I have large contracts and those businesses aren't big enough.\"In fact, many national corporations have such burdensome contracting requirements that small businesses, especially those of color, simply don't have the resources to apply for them. As a result, more established competitors have a persistent advantage. \"It's built in,\" Black says. \"But structures are held up by people.\"Fortunately, at least a few of those structures are being dismantled.*****Five years ago, when Minneapolis faced a community uprising due to a previous police killing, Target Corp. \u2014 one of the state\u2019s largest employers \u2014 made a serious effort to address underlying inequalities in the area\u2019s business community. It not only started contracting with very small companies in North Minneapolis, home to a large black community, but tried to eliminate burdensome language from the contracts.That kind of thing is good for companies and economies both. But truly reducing inequality will also demand fresh thinking about job creation. Black notes that in the Twin Cities and other regions, black small businesses are heavily concentrated in areas like restaurants, catering, barbershops and hair salons. Those are important industries. \"But chances are,\" Black said, \"the jobs those create aren't going to change our wealth gap.\"Doing so will require more intentional support from big companies in sectors like tech. Several years ago, the Itasca Project, an organization that includes some of the Twin Cities' most important employers, created a program to encourage contracting with small local companies. There was a belief, Black said, that \u201cthose dollars would naturally trickle to businesses owned by people of color.\" She sighed. \"Nothing trickles.\"Now CEI is working with Itasca to add race-based goals to the program. That approach\u00a0could prove transformative: According to CEI's data, if the rate of white and minority business ownership in Minnesota were at parity, the state would have another 87,000 jobs.That's reason for hope in the midst of some of the bleakest days ever faced by the Twin Cities. But will it lead to real change? Is it an inflection point for the region, and for American corporations?\"It is, and it has to be,\" Black said. \"And I pray that we pause in it long enough to create deep and sustained change.\"This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Adam Minter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Billionaire Ray Dalio said in a live LinkedIn interview that in terms of the broader historical context, the recent economic downturn should be \u201crelatively brief,\" and could spur significant societal progress. This would include a worldwide \u201crestructuring\u201d lasting approximately three to five years.\u201cI know that\u2019s a long time, but it\u2019s not forever. The human capacity to adapt and invent and come out of this is much greater,\u201d Dalio commented. He added, \u201cI think we should be very excited about the new future. We\u2019re now in a wonderful revolution in terms of the capacity to think and use that in a way. I would say that is absolutely the most treasured thing in the future.\u201dStill making sure to account for the unknowns, Dalio has been diversifying his investments across geographic locations, asset class and currencies throughout the ongoing public health crisis.  Looking to Dalio for investing inspiration, we used TipRanks\u2019 database to find out if three stocks the billionaire recently added to the fund represent compelling plays. According to the platform, the analyst community believes they do, with all of the picks earning \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus ratings. Let\u2019s jump right in.Philip Morris International (PM)Cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company Philip Morris has become known as a \u201csin stock.\" However, regardless of its product portfolio, Dalio sees plenty of upside in store.Recently, the billionaire\u2019s fund acquired a new position in PM, snapping up 67,447 shares. The value of this new addition? More than $4.9 million.Turning now to the analysts, the stock boasts a strong fan base, which includes Piper Sandler\u2019s Michael Lavery. He doesn\u2019t dispute the fact that there are some headwinds facing the company. \u201cPM expects near-term iQOS new user acquisition to be about 50% lower than it originally planned due to social distancing measures that have shut iQOS stores and made it harder to engage with consumers,\u201d Lavery stated.That being said, the company has already surpassed Lavery\u2019s expectations, which were cut to near-zero. The analyst even says that if PM can maintain the pace of its customer acquisition, there could be upside to his estimates. The analyst added, \u201cWe expect HeatStick volume growth of 20% in 2020E (1Q20: +45%) and believe 90-100 billion sticks in 2021 is still achievable.\u201dWhile lower duty-free volumes and down-trading in Indonesia could take a toll on second quarter EPS, Lavery remains optimistic. \u201cWe remain bullish on PM's strong long-term outlook, and we expect nicotine demand to remain resilient near-term (particularly in times of personal stress),\u201d he explained.It should also be noted that PM has had to grapple with patent infringement claims from British American Tobacco (BAT) and a transactional currency hit. Speaking to the first issue, Lavery said, \u201cWe reviewed BAT's six patents named in its U.S. complaint, and it is difficult to handicap an outcome, but a third-party reviewer of patents generally did not give BAT's relevant ones here very high marks.\u201dAs for the latter, Lavery points out that about $100 million of the currency hit in the first quarter of 2020 was driven by the revaluation of euro or dollar denominated payables in markets like Russia, but he doesn\u2019t foresee another event of this magnitude happening again.Based on all of the above, Lavery kept an Overweight rating on the stock. He did reduce the price target from $98 to $95, but this still implies shares could climb 40% higher in the next year. (To watch Lavery\u2019s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, other analysts are in agreement. 7 Buys and 2 Holds add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. In addition, the $83.56 average price target brings the upside potential to 23%. (See Philip Morris stock analysis on TipRanks)UnitedHealth Group (UNH)Hoping to help people live healthier lives and make the healthcare system work more efficiently, UnitedHealth Group offers a wide range of healthcare products and insurance services. While the late-March acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a somewhat lackluster quarter, Dalio believes the company\u2019s future is bright.To this end, Bridgewater went in on UNH. In a purchase valued at $5,481,000, Dalio\u2019s hedge fund scooped up 21,977 shares.Five-star analyst Michael Wiederhorn agrees that UNH is moving on to bigger and better things, noting that its Q1 performance was relatively solid. \u201cOverall, UNH produced strong results and seems well-positioned to navigate the COVID pandemic due to a relatively stable top-line, a diversified business mix and a dominant position across its businesses.\u201dWiederhorn tells investors that management thinks the slowdown in non-COVID-irelated utilization, which was driven by highly constrained elective care and will be offset by the late-year pent-up utilization, will have a significant impact on MCR in the second quarter. As a result, despite some uncertainty surrounding COVID-19's impact, UNH maintained its full year 2020 EPS guidance of $16.25-$16.55.Adding to the good news, Wiederhorn argues that its Optum segment has a strong standing within the market. Expounding on this, he noted, \u201cTrends at Optum remained solid, and management did note that even OptumHealth should be positioned to hold up relatively well due to its reliance on risk-based contracts, accounting for two thirds of revenues. Both OptumRx and OptumInsight have strong pipelines (though the timing of meetings was disrupted) with the latter of particular interest as companies look to improve the economics and delivery of healthcare.\u201dEven though commercial enrollment could be hampered by elevated levels of unemployment, higher Medicaid should partially offset this. Additionally, UNH is in the early stages of pricing and benefit design for 2021, with its plans possibly including pricing for COVID-19 testing and a potential vaccine.Bearing this in mind, Wiederhorn maintained an Outperform call and $343 price target. Should this target be met, a twelve-month gain of 18% could be in the cards. (To watch Wiederhorn\u2019s track record, click here)Turning now to the rest of the Street, other analysts also like what they\u2019re seeing. With 12 Buys and 2 Holds, the word on the Street is that UNH is a Strong Buy. At $326.23, the average price target indicates 12% upside potential. (See UnitedHealth stock analysis on TipRanks)Accenture PLC (ACN)Dalio\u2019s third recent addition, Accenture, provides management and technology consulting services and solutions to help its clients, which inhabit almost every industry, create lasting value. With the company relying on a new strategy, Dalio thinks it has set itself up for success.Not wanting to miss out on a compelling opportunity, Bridgewater pulled the trigger on 27,763 shares, giving it a new position in ACN. Looking at the value of the new holding, it comes in at more than $4.5 million.When it comes to the analysts, they are also singing the company\u2019s praises. Writing for BNP Paribas, analyst Ben Castillo-Bernaus argues that COVID-19's disruption has presented investors with an opportunity to buy a \u201chigh-quality\u201d IT service company, with ACN trading well below historical five-year average EBIT multiples.\u201cAccenture remains \u2018best in class\u2019 and the recent weakness is an opportunity to gain a position in this IT Services global leader delivering 40% returns on capital,\u201d Castillo-Bernaus stated. He added, \u201cAccenture has been a pioneer in developing \u2018the New\u2019 with 65% of revenues now coming from high growth Digital, Cloud and Security services.\u201dAs for what makes the company so successful and allows it to continuously take market share, Castillo-Bernaus points to its investments in new technologies and growth areas. To back up this conclusion, the analyst cites its EUR1 billion investment in training each year and EUR800 million investment in R&D; all while delivering margin improvements every year. On top of this, ACN conducts smaller-scale M&A;, with it working alongside the companies before an acquisition to limit any potential deal failures.Castillo-Bernaus also noted, \u201cWe believe Accenture has customers that spend more than $100 million annually, with 98% of Accenture\u2019s top 100 clients having been clients for more than five years. These \u2018sticky\u2019 relationships help Accenture maintain high margins and high returns as Accenture has a high number of \u2018sole source\u2019 wins where it does not even see competition in RFPs.\u201dThat being said, the company has started using a new approach. It will now organize itself by Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations instead of by verticals, and the results will be reported geographically for these segments. \u201cWe believe it is too early to tell what kind of impact these changes will have, but Accenture has a positive track record of occasionally tweaking its growth strategy in order to best deliver on the opportunities ahead,\u201d Castillo-Bernaus commented.It should come as no surprise, then, that Castillo-Bernaus joined the bulls. Along with an Outperform rating, he initiated coverage by setting a $215 price target. This target conveys the analyst\u2019s confidence in ACN's ability to surge 17% in the next twelve months.In general, other Wall Street analysts have also been impressed. ACN\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating breaks down into 13 Buys and 2 Holds assigned in the last three months. However, the $195.29 average price target suggests modest upside potential of 6%.
