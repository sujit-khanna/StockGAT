The McDonald's board offered Easterbrook an extremely generous exit package to depart amid allegations of an improper relationship with a female employee, CtW's executive chairman said. CtW and other shareholders raised their concerns at the time, he said, adding that a payout sets a \"toxic tone at the top\" of the company, Waizenegger said, speaking Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"The board failed to act, even after media outlets reported on Easterbrook's improper relationships and a broader party culture among the C-suite, he said.\"It is amazing to us you wouldn't look at all the corners in the closet to make sure you don't find the skeletons that could come back to haunt you.\" Investor Singles Out Board Members: Waizenegger singled out McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. and Richard Lenny, who is head of the compensation committee, as the two most senior board members that he said are responsible for the situation. The two board members failed to conduct a proper investigation ahead of Easterbrook's official termination and now the company could be stuck with a very expensive and drawn-out litigation process, Waizenegger said.The outcome of the litigation is unclear, and there is a chance McDonald's might not even get the money back, he said. \"We want to see consequences for the board as well.\" 'Enormous' Embarrassment: McDonald's faces \"enormous\" embarrassment, as there is reason to believe the company oversaw a \"poor and inadequate\" investigation of Easterbrook, Fox News senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano said Monday in a Fox Business interview.McDonald's included a stipulation in Easterbrook's package that his compensation will be null and void if the former CEO is found guilty of lying to the board, Napolitano said. Yet the deal also includes a stipulation that McDonald's will pay for Easterbrook's legal fees in any lawsuit, he said. McDonald's Has Witnesses: McDonald's is believed to be cooperating with women who had sexual relationships with Easterbrook and will testify in court, Napolitano said.The likely outcome will be a settlement between the two sides in which Easterbrook will give \"some\" of the compensation back to avoid further embarrassment in the form of a public trial, he said.

McDonald's is suing Easterbrook for the amount of his exit package -- around $40 million -- in Delaware's Court of Chancery. What Hapened: In October 2019, McDonald's had learned of an allegation that Easterbrook engaged in an inappropriate personal relationship with a McDonald's employee, the company said.  The board commissioned an investigation of the allegation.The investigation confirmed that the alleged relationship had occurred and revealed that it had been a non-physical, consensual relationship involving texting and video calls, according to McDonald's. Easterbrook told internal investigators the relationship was the only one of an intimate nature he had ever had with a McDonald's employee, the company said, Easterbrook said he never engaged in a physical sexual relationship with any McDonald's employee, the company said. On Nov. 1, the McDonald's board fired  Easterbrook.Why It's Imortant: The board concluded that Easterbrook violated company policy by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate, but also that his conduct demonstrated poor judgment that disqualified him from continued service as the CEO.MCD Price Action: McDonald's shares were trading down 0.67% at $203.25 at last check Monday. The stock has a 52-week high of $221.93 and a 52-week low of $124.23.Related Links:McDonald's Reports Q2 Earnings BeatMcDonald's Hit New All-Time High After Quarter Pounder Update, Bullish RatingPhoto courtesy of McDonald's.

While the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act didn\u2019t ultimately provide extra money for franchises, it arguably provided something far more valuable: It mandated that\u00a0franchises \u2014 regardless of how many stores or restaurants they operated or how many people they employed in those outlets \u2014\u00a0would be eligible for federal small business aid.Given that Paycheck Protection Program funds were initially supposed to go only to companies with 500 or fewer employees, this was a significant concession. It meant that large national\u00a0operators, some of which employed thousands of people, could snare PPP funding by applying store by store. You know what happened after that. Big operators such as Shake Shack Inc. and Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group Inc. received big loans;\u00a0authentically small businesses were left out;\u00a0and a healthy round of public criticism of the PPP program ensued. (Shake Shack and Ruth\u2019s Hospitality decided to return\u00a0their loans.)One of the four legislators who pushed for special bailout treatment for franchises in March was Representative Kevin Hern, a Republican from Oklahoma. Hern campaigned for his House seat in 2018 as a can-do businessman who has successfully operated a chain of McDonald\u2019s franchises in his home state. I wrote a column in April asking whether Hern had positioned his own businesses for a rescue on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.Hern and his office declined to comment when I asked in April whether his franchises would apply for federal aid \u2014 and whether doing so would be a financial conflict of interest. They also declined to comment on any discussions Hern may have had about the CARES Act with McDonald\u2019s Corp., the fast-food giant that doles out franchises to entrepreneurs like Hern. On Monday, the Small Business Administration finally answered one of those questions. It released the names of some of the biggest recipients of PPP funds and, as it turns out, a Tulsa enterprise controlled by Hern, KTAK Corporation I, received $1 million to $2 million.KTAK operates fast-food franchises the Hern family owns. I contacted Hern\u2019s office again on Monday and asked for information about any role he played in getting PPP funding for KTAK. I also asked whether his family\u2019s McDonald's franchises received PPP funding directly and, if so, how much they received. I also asked Hern\u2019s office to disclose any other businesses in which he has a financial or management interest that received PPP funding. Hern and his representatives didn\u2019t respond to any of those questions.In a press release, Hern\u2019s chief of staff, Cameron Foster, said that his boss \u201chas been open and transparent with members of the community about his family business\u2019 need of a Paycheck Protection Program Loan during the Covid-19 crisis.\u201d Foster also said that Hern was \u201chappy to share that the family business was able to keep all employees either at their current level of employment or move part-time employees to full time.\u201dIf all of Hern\u2019s employees did, in fact, stay on his companies\u2019 payrolls, that\u2019s a good thing. But securing PPP funding also presumably meant that Hern and his family could keep their businesses operating \u2014 a direct financial benefit for the congressman himself. And Hern got that funding ahead of somebody else, possibly much smaller businesses that lacked his resources and connections.Concerns that insiders would benefit from the PPP program have shadowed the bailout from the moment it was enacted in March. Schumer personally promised that no bailout money would go to businesses controlled by President Donald Trump or his family members. Language was added to the CARES Act to try to\u00a0ensure that didn\u2019t happen. But Congress then exempted PPP \u2014 one of the most heavily funded bailout programs \u2014 from those provisions.So far, it doesn\u2019t appear as if the Trumps have received public funds directly. But the Washington Post reported on Monday that dozens of businesses that operate in Trump-owned or Trump-controlled buildings obtained PPP funds. Bloomberg News reported that a business partner of the Trumps in Hawaii received a PPP loan. Corporate entities tied to the family of the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also pulled in some PPP funds.The law firm founded by one of Trump\u2019s longstanding personal attorneys, Marc Kasowitz, received PPP funds of $5 million to $10 million.\u00a0Companies linked to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also received PPP loans, as did a company linked to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Bloomberg News reported. Two Democrats, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Susie Lee, as well as two Republicans, Vicky Hartzler and Roger Williams, are also linked to businesses that have snared PPP funds.The SBA and the Treasury Department have been the primary administrators of the PPP program, and they\u2019ve been unusually lax about properly overseeing and administering the hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money that they\u2019ve handed over to small businesses thus far. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resisted disclosing the identities of PPP borrowers for months until public hearings forced his hand. The SBA even waived conflict-of-interest and ethics guidelines that have traditionally prevented legislators from gaining access to the agency\u2019s loans.So when public officials like Hern are the beneficiaries of taxpayer-funded programs like PPP, it winds up not being illegal or unethical simply because the federal government says it isn\u2019t.Hern once owned\u00a0as many as 18 McDonald\u2019s franchises in the Tulsa area that employed more than 1,000 people, though that has shrunk to just five franchises more recently. He continues to own his McDonald\u2019s franchises while serving in Congress because\u00a0federal ethics and conflicts-of-interest guidelines\u00a0allow him to. While the\u00a0guidelines limit\u00a0how much outside income\u00a0legislators can earn while serving in Congress, they permit exceptions for performing some kinds of outside work \u2014 including practicing medicine or advising a family-owned business.Financial disclosures\u00a0that Hern filed in 2018 said his restaurants contributed $25 million to $50 million of value to an overall portfolio of personal holdings worth between $38.7 million and $92.9 million at the time. An Oklahoma nonprofit news organization,\u00a0The Frontier, nicknamed Hern \u201cthe McCongressman.\u201dHern seemed committed to altering that perception when he ran for Congress in 2018. \u201cKevin will use his experience and knowledge to focus on leading Congress by example, and put an end to the typical behaviors of career politicians,\u201d his campaign pledged at the time.Maybe all that PPP money changed his mind.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Timothy L.

SYY stock had posted a decade of sustained growth, and last December closed at $85.80, an all-time record high. The company was also a dividends champ. Then, the novel coronavirus pandemic derailed Sysco, as it did most stocks. However, the stock has been slower to recover than many. Currently trading around the $54 level, it's still down 37% from its December 2019 levels.Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com So does that makes Sysco's stock a buy? I think it's pretty risky, and I'll explain why in a moment. SYY stock currently has a C-Rating in my Portfolio Grader, although it does maintain its A-Rating in my Dividend Grader. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips The Pandemic Decimated the Restaurant SectorSysco's business is focused on the food service industry. The company sells and distributes food and food preparation equipment to restaurants, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, military bases and hotels. If you happen to be up at the crack of dawn and walking through an urban center, you'll see the Sysco trucks rumbling from restaurant to restaurant.At least you did prior to the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.With the coronavirus lockdown, restaurants were forced to shut their dining rooms. Those that could pivoted to takeout, but that volume couldn't match their normal level of business. That meant orders for food and equipment from Sysco took a hit.In its third-quarter fiscal 2020 earnings report (released on May 5) Sysco showed the damage to its business. Sales of $13.7 billion for the quarter were down 6.5% year-over-year. Analysts had been looking for earnings per share of 84 cents, but instead the company reported EPS of 45 cents. Not just a miss, but down significantly from the 79 cents per share posted a year ago.  * 7 Utilities Stocks to Buy With Reassuring Dividends How bad has the pandemic been? Sysco included this introduction in its earnings press release: \"Over the last 50 years, Sysco has weathered its share of exogenous shocks and economic crises, and each time Sysco has remained a resolute foodservice industry leader. The extent of the COVID-19 crisis is more substantial than any other throughout the company's history.\"So it was good news for Sysco that states have begun reopening restaurants. Or is it? Restaurants are Re-ClosingThe reopening of restaurants across the U.S. has not gone well. Covid-19 cases are on the rise, there are battles over wearing masks, and many restaurants that had reopened in recent weeks are now closing again.Patio dining is a lifeline to some -- offering an opportunity for social distancing and fresh air -- but that only works during good weather. And what happens in the winter? A Coronavirus Vaccine Is KeyThere are many industries that are desperately waiting for the arrival of a coronavirus vaccine. Airlines, hotels and cruise lines are in big trouble until people can safely travel once again. The biotech industry is all hands on deck, racing to develop a vaccine.The restaurant industry is also hurting and in a position where business won't return to any semblance of normalcy until a vaccine is available. While fast food chains are faring better thanks to their focus on takeout, the industry has been devastated. As of the end of March, an estimated 30,000 U.S. restaurants had closed permanently. That number is projected to soon pass 110,000, according to the National Restaurant Association. The coronavirus pandemic has hammered restaurant stocks, even the fast food giants that are less impacted by the closure of dining rooms. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is still down 7.3% for 2020. Pizza Hut and Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) is down nearly 14%. Cheesecake Factory (NASDAQ:CAKE), which was built around casual in-restaurant dining, has seen its shares lose over 43% of their value so far this year.SYY stock has reflected the doom and gloom surrounding its key customer base, shedding 34% of its value since the start of the year. Bottom Line on SYY StockSysco is a gamble at this point. On the plus side, you have a company that dominates its industry. It has seen its shares steadily gain in value over the past decade, and it's a solid performer on the dividend front.Even during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, it still had customers like hospitals and military bases that require restocking. Its fast-food customers have been more resilient than others. And Sysco has operations in other countries that are in more advanced stages of pandemic recovery.However, there is a real risk that the U.S. restaurant industry -- Sysco's core business -- is going to be hit even worse than it has been. The U.S. is setting daily coronavirus infection records, and some restaurants that had reopened have been closing down again. Many of these may never reopen again, even if a vaccine is found. That gloomy prognosis makes me wary of SYY stock at this point. It may yet recover, but I think even in a best case scenario the path back to its 2019 levels is going to be a long one.Louis Navellier had an unconventional start, as a grad student who accidentally built a market-beating stock system -- with returns rivaling even Warren Buffett.
