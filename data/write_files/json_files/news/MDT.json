PACT\u2122 AV DCB Is Safe, Reduces Reinterventions, and Helps Maintain Dialysis Access for Those Living with End-Stage Renal DiseaseDUBLIN, Aug. 19, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u00a0Medtronic announced today the\u00a0publication\u00a0of the primary endpoint results from the\u00a0IN.PACT AV Access trial in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine.1 The results reinforce\u00a0that the\u00a0IN.PACT\u2122 AV drug-coated balloon (DCB) limits the number of reinterventions needed to maintain blood flow (patency) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have arteriovenous (AV) fistulae, leading to fewer interruptions to their dialysis therapy.Nearly 2.5 million ESRD patients worldwide regularly undergo hemodialysis2\u00a0\u2014 many of whom require AV fistulae in order to receive continuous dialysis. For these patients, AV fistulae serve as lifelines, and maintaining access to these sites is essential.\u00a0Vessels that feed the access site can narrow (restenose) over time, however, and patients often undergo multiple maintenance procedures per year to restore access site function.\u00a0The need for frequent reinterventions can result in repeated hospital visits and significant disruptions to critical hemodialysis care.\u00a0Therefore, by being able to maintain access site patency, patients may experience longer periods of successful, uninterrupted dialysis.\u201cThe six-month data demonstrate that with IN.PACT AV DCB, we can cut the number of reinterventions required to maintain vessel patency in half. This technology may positively impact patients\u2019 quality of life, and demonstrate meaningful reductions in projected costs to the healthcare system,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Robert Lookstein, M.D., M.H.C.D.L., U.S. study principal investigator, professor of radiology and surgery, executive vice-chair in the Department of Diagnostic, Molecular, and Interventional Radiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, New York. \u201cRight now, this is very important for ESRD patients on hemodialysis, who are at especially high risk of acquired infections. This technology may have the potential to allow these patients to experience continued, uninterrupted access to life-saving dialysis care, including fewer hospital visits to get their access sites maintained.\u201dThe IN.PACT AV Access study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which has enrolled 330 subjects at 29 sites in United States, Japan, and New Zealand. Notably, the IN.PACT AV DCB is the first and only approved DCB for the treatment of failing AV access to meet both its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints. Through six months, the rate of target lesion primary patency was substantially higher in participants treated in the IN.PACT AV DCB group compared to those in the PTA control group (82.2% vs. 59.5% (p<0.001)). Kaplan-Meier estimates for this dataset indicate:  * 86.1% primary patency rate in the IN.PACT AV DCB group compared to 68.9% in the PTA control group (log-rank p<0.001) of the target lesion at 180 days.\u00a0  * 81.4% primary patency rate in the IN.PACT AV DCB group compared to 59.0% in\u00a0the PTA control group (log-rank p<0.001) through 210 days.Furthermore,\u00a0patients treated with IN.PACT AV DCB required 56% fewer reinterventions to maintain lesion patency as compared to those treated with standard PTA through six months.For its primary safety endpoint, the IN.PACT AV DCB group showed non-inferiority versus the PTA control group in the rate of severe adverse events (SAEs) involving the AV access circuit within 30 days. Through 12 months, the mortality rate was comparable between the IN.PACT AV DCB group and the PTA control group (9.4% vs. 9.6%, log-rank p=0.931).\u201cWhen treated with standard PTA, ESRD patients requiring AV fistula maintenance often have to undergo anywhere from 1-3 access procedures per year. This, in addition to their multiple weekly dialysis appointments, results in even more time spent in a healthcare setting,\u201d said Terry Litchfield, M.P.H., president of Access Solutions, an organization focused on patient advocacy related to vascular access services. \u201cThese newly-published data on IN.PACT AV DCB not only show promise in keeping people living with ESRD out of the hospital for longer, they also demonstrate that using this DCB will reduce the number of interventions a patient will need each year, thus avoiding the time and expense of additional procedures to keep their dialysis access working well.\u201d\u201cThe publication of the six-month results in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0adds to the body of evidence of the safety and clinical benefit of this paclitaxel-coated platform,\u201d said Mark Pacyna, vice president and general manager of the Peripheral Vascular business, which is part of the Cardiac and Vascular Group at Medtronic. \u201cThe IN.PACT AV DCB\u00a0extends the time between reinterventions and reduces hospital visits.\u00a0These clinical benefits are critically important for this patient population, especially in today\u2019s environment, and Medtronic is committed to helping people with ESRD maintain access to life-saving dialysis.\u201dAbout Medtronic  Medtronic plc (www.medtronic.com), headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is among the world's largest medical technology, services and solutions companies\u00a0\u2013\u00a0alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world.

Last month, the gap between the average analyst price target and where the shares were trading hit a record $85.31 on July 17. The discrepancy is almost unprecedented in health care, where sell-side analysts typically swoon over high-growth names, especially those that have a stranglehold on their market.Intuitive\u2019s biggest Wall Street skeptic, Oppenheimer analyst Suraj Kalia, predicts the stock will shed almost half of its value in the next 12 months. Kalia sees the company\u2019s rapid growth as likely to falter due to Covid-19 and weak demand from cash-strapped hospitals.\u201cA closer look at fundamentals tells you that the hyper-growth days are behind us,\u201d Kalia wrote after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings report last month. \u201cIn the current environment of complete disconnect between valuation and fundamentals, we are losing the battle to ascribe irrational multiples\u201d despite a worldwide drop in medical procedures amid the pandemic.Three of the 20 banks tracked by Bloomberg recommend selling shares, while five others have hold-equivalent ratings, meaning they view Intuitive as fairly priced after being one of the better performers in the S&P 500 since it replaced Bear Stearns in 2008.Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar, who rates the shares underperform, warned clients that the recovery for procedures will be \u201ca long one\u201d as the resurgence of the coronavirus in some states has made patients delay non-essential surgeries. He expects procedures fell further in July and says hospitals will be unable to buy new robotic systems.The Sunnyvale, California-based seller of the da Vinci Surgical System reached a record $704 a share late last month. Wednesday\u2019s closing value of almost $80 billion compares with about $12 billion in August of 2010. The company has a larger market value than Stryker Corp. -- a medical-device maker with more than three times the annual revenue -- or health insurers like Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp.Shares of Intuitive have also benefited from hiccups by heavyweights looking to break into robot-assisted surgery. Johnson & Johnson disclosed what Bernstein called a \u201csignificant delay\u201d last month for its robotic surgery program. Oppenheimer said J&J is taking a sensible, but more extensive path to approval, while other rival platforms also continue to progress.Medtronic Inc. has long been viewed as the most likely player to dent Intuitive\u2019s dominance. Medtronic gave a live demonstration of its robot in September but said on its earnings call in May that testing had been delayed due to Covid-19 disruptions.With investor focus predominantly on competition from Medtronic and J&J, a joint venture of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Sysmex Corp. surprised some on Wall Street when its hinotori Surgical Robot System quietly won approval from Japanese regulators for urology surgeries. The news came with limited details on pricing; however, the presence of a competitor in a major market dispels expectations that competition will be delayed for years, Evercore ISI\u2019s Kumar wrote Wednesday.Extended Use ProgramLater this year, Intuitive plans to introduce an extended use program that will lower the price of some instruments in an attempt to drive more use of its da Vinci robots in less complex procedures. Critics say the program will pressure the company\u2019s gross margins.The strategy could also deliver a \u201cmaterial blow to current and future competition,\u201d according to Raymond James analyst Lawrence Keusch. \u201cGiven potential competitors, specifically Medtronic, have discussed trying to get costs on par with non-robotic modalities, we think beating them to this threshold extends the competitive advantage for Intuitive,\u201d he wrote.Flexible financing options will help drive broader adoption of Intuitive\u2019s robots ahead of U.S. competition starting sometime around 2022, according to bulls. Intuitive is planning to launch the program in October, a decision that will allow customers to work through their existing inventories before transitioning over to the more affordable instruments.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-68-billion-rally-bears-121704746.html"}, {"symbol": "MDT", "publishedDate": "2020-08-13 11:57:11", "title": "Medtronic Plans New Acquisition in AI-Driven Diabetes Care", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Medtronic's (MDT) acquisition of Companion Medical aims to expand service to diabetics using multiple daily injections for diabetes management.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plans-acquisition-ai-driven-115711500.html"}, {"symbol": "MDT", "publishedDate": "2020-08-11 15:00:00", "title": "Medtronic to Announce Financial Results for Its First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2021", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "DUBLIN, Aug. 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) announced today that it will report financial results for its first quarter of fiscal year 2021 on Tuesday, August 25, 2020.

Cleveland Clinic performed the first patient implant in the nation with the new device.Sacral neuromodulation sends electrical impulses to the sacral nerves located in the lower back to improve bladder and bowel control. Unlike oral medications that target the muscular component of bladder control, SNM offers control of symptoms through direct modulation of the nerve activity, normalizing the communication between the bladder and the brain.1,2\"Effective long-term bladder and bowel control is needed for almost 55 million adults3,4,5,6\u00a0in the United States who often experience regular accidents and/or frequency issues that are associated with overactive bladder (OAB) and fecal incontinence (FI),\u201d said Sandip Vasavada, M.D., professor at the Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute and section head Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery, Cleveland Clinic. \u201cA new FDA-approved option for these patients is a step forward.\u201d\u00a0Dr. Vasavada discloses compensation for speaker/trainer/educator activities.About InterStim Micro    * At 2.8 cm3, it is 50% smaller than the market\u2019s other rechargeable SNM device, making it the world\u2019s smallest.  * Allows patients to choose how and when they want to charge their device \u2014from a quick charge once a week, or as infrequent as once per month, depending on the patient\u2019s preference or device settings.  * Features SureScan\u2122 MRI technology, which enables full-body MRI conditional scans.  * Does not require impedance checks prior to an MRI scan, providing more efficiency in patient care versus the other SNM system on the market.  * Can recharge from zero to 100% in less than an hour, making it the fastest battery available.  * Reduces the need for battery replacement surgeries due to its life of 15 years.\u201cPatients unfortunately limit their lives socially, professionally and personally due to OAB and FI,\u201d said Howard Goldman, M.D., professor and vice chairman of Quality and Patient Safety, Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute, Cleveland Clinic. \u201cWith this newly FDA-approved device, we have a new option and can offer more patients sacral neuromodulation therapy and improve their quality of life.\u201d\u00a0Dr. Goldman discloses compensation for speaker/trainer/educator and consulting activities.\u201cOAB and FI patients want to live a life without limits, and we designed our new rechargeable SNM system to advance this reality,\u201d said Brooke Story, vice president and general manager of the Pelvic Health& Gastric Therapies business, which is part of the Restorative Therapies Group at Medtronic. \u201cWe created our entire InterStim portfolio in partnership with physicians backed by a 25-year track record of experience in sacral neuromodulation including over 325,000 implanted patients, 5-year clinical data and more than 1,000 peer-reviewed articles.

They aim to deliver meaningful impact through deep engagement, greater understanding of racial inequities, improved educational opportunities and fewer health disparities, which have been precipitated by historical racial inequities and intensified by COVID-19.\u201cAs a global healthcare leader, our Mission calls us to maintain good global citizenship as a company,\u201d said Geoff Martha, Medtronic chief executive officer. \u201cToday, it\u2019s critical that we actively promote social justice and racial equity progress to address inequities and health disparities in our communities. The Medtronic Foundation\u2019s commitments come as an extension of the Medtronic journey to consistently improve and advance these efforts.\u201d\u00a0Long-term Partnerships for Social Change\u00a0  As part of its commitment, the Medtronic Foundation is entering into three long-term, multi-year core partnerships at local and national levels:  1. Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF):\u00a0This first-of-its-kind national partnership between the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and a medical technology corporate foundation will emphasize scholarships for low-income students studying engineering, biomedical, and business at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across the U.S. The partnership also includes opportunities for students engaged in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) at HBCUs to learn more about medical technology.  2. Northside Achievement Zone (NAZ): This local partnership will strengthen communities in North Minneapolis by helping impoverished families upgrade skills, increase household income, and support their children through high school and college. Medtronic employees will have year-round opportunities to volunteer their skills and support NAZ families to improve education disparities in Minneapolis.  3. People\u2019s Center Clinics & Services: This health partnership builds the capacity of community-based frontline health workers and local healthcare teams, enabling them to reduce health disparities, improve diabetes and hypertension management, and provide COVID-19 education and support, resulting in better health outcomes among the East African and African American populations.

Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session.The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 27.17%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Medical Devices stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year.The P/E ratio is used by long-term shareholders to assess the company's market performance against aggregate market data, historical earnings, and the industry at large. A lower P/E indicates that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future, and that the company is probably undervalued. It shows that shareholders are less than willing to pay a high share price, because they do not expect the company to exhibit growth, in terms of future earnings.Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others.Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 144.75 in the Medical Devices industry, Medtronic Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 25.9.

Medtronic\u2019s engineering, clinical, and regulatory teams will conduct the development work for the programs.Blackstone\u2019s investment is sought to pull forward specific programs for its diabetes pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) pipeline devices that aim to address unmet patient needs. If the programs are successful, Medtronic will pay royalties which are expected to be in the low- to mid-single digit range as a percentage of sales.\u00a0Additional terms of the arrangement were not disclosed.Medtronic\u2019s diabetes device portfolio is tailored to provide greater lifestyle flexibility to Type 1 diabetes patients, which includes about 22 million individuals worldwide and 1.5 million individuals in the U.S.Separately, the medical technology company over the weekend announced positive results from its US pivotal trial of its MiniMed 780G Advanced Hybrid Closed Loop (AHCL) insulin pump at the virtual American Diabetes Association (ADA) conference. The investigational MiniMed 780G system is designed to automate the delivery of both base-level insulin and correction doses to help people with diabetes avoid highs and lows.\u201cThis investment is important for people living with diabetes, as we\u00a0expect it will expand our offering of future insulin delivery and sensor innovations that have the potential to\u00a0improve patients\u2019 management of their diabetes,\u201d said Sean Salmon, president of Medtronic\u2019s Diabetes Group. \u201cOver the past 12 months, Medtronic has significantly increased its investment in Diabetes R&D;, including investments in a series of near-term programs such as the\u00a0MiniMe 780G insulin pump system, our Personalized Closed Loop (PCL) system, our extended wear infusion set, and our Zeus and Synergy sensors.\u201dFor Blackstone\u2019s life sciences division, the investment represents the first of its kind in the medical devices space.Shares in Medtronic rose 2.6% to $93.21 at the close on Friday, trimming its year-to-date decline to 18%. Blackstone advanced 1.3% to $55.73.SunTrust analyst Kaila Krum last month cut Medtronic's price target to $105 from $130, while maintaining a Buy rating on the shares after Q4 earnings missed the Street\u2019s expectations.However, Krum is confident that the investments the company is making today will have a long-term positive growth impact.Overall, Wall Street analysts have a cautiously optimistic\u00a0Moderate Buy\u00a0outlook on the stock.

That was alongside an average A1C blood sugar level of 7.0%, with autocorrection contributing to 22% of all bolus insulin and participants being in SmartGuard (closed loop) 95% of the time. Mean sensor glucose (SG) was at 148 mg/dL overall, and 144 mg/dL at the default 100mg/dl target.Results\u00a0from a study questionnaire\u00a0also demonstrated high user satisfaction with 96% indicating it was easy to use.Lastly, the lower target glucose and active insulin time (AIT) settings substantially improved\u00a0Time in Range, without increasing hypoglycemia.

Patients also reported being highly satisfied with their experience overall, with 85% agreeing that the system improved their quality of life.\u201cWe wanted to design a system that further simplifies diabetes management and provides an extra layer of protection for the times one may forget a pre-meal bolus or miscalculate their carbohydrates\u201d explained Robert Vigersky, CMO for Medtronic\u2019s Diabetes Group.Data from the pivotal study will be submitted as part of a Premarket Approval (PMA) application to the U.

In April, the country\u2019s richest man surveyed his cradle-to-grave conglomerate and made a decision. He was getting into ventilators.In the worst cases of Covid-19, the virus attacks the lungs, making it harder to get oxygen to the bloodstream. A ventilator can be the difference between life and death, and there aren\u2019t enough of them. By one estimate, the world\u2019s hospitals could use another 800,000.The shortage is most acute in the developing world\u2014South Sudan, for example, has just four ventilators for a population of 12 million\u2014but the world\u2019s richest country is short, too. After reports that some hard-hit New York City hospitals had jury-rigged ventilators to serve two patients at the same time, President Donald Trump compelled automakers and other U.S. companies to start making the devices. Ford Motor Co. and General Electric Co. teamed up to deliver 50,000 ventilators by July 13 in a $336 million government contract.Vuong believes his\u00a0company, Vingroup JSC, can do it faster and for less money. Using an open-source design from\u00a0device maker Medtronic Plc, Vingroup submitted a working ventilator for regulator approval in mid-April. While the company waits for Vietnam\u2019s regulators to give the go-ahead, ventilators are rolling\u00a0off the assembly line.Vingroup\u2019s ventilators cost around $7,000 in Vietnam, 30% less than Medtronic\u2019s own model. The company also says it could produce as many as 55,000 a month as soon as the government approves them and plans to export them wherever there\u2019s demand. Vingroup says it\u2019ll donate several thousand to Ukraine and Russia, where Vuong has long-standing business ties.\u201cFor the time being, we will focus on producing lots of ventilators\u2014and doing it really well,\u201d said the 51-year-old Vuong, who shared his plans over the course of a few months in a rare interview at Vingroup\u2019s Hanoi headquarters and in a series of emails. \u201cWe want to join hands with the Vietnamese government to solve a part of the pandemic problem.\u201dWhile Vingroup runs a handful of hospitals and clinics, being a medical device manufacturer hadn\u2019t been on the agenda. But Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine, is known for an ambition that dovetails Vietnam\u2019s own. So when the country pushed domestic manufacturers to make more sophisticated products, Vingroup started making cars and smartphones.\u00a0Now, as the government gives away cases of made-in-Vietnam face masks to virus-hit countries overseas, Vuong is making ventilators part of an even more ambitious global campaign: selling Vietnamese cars to the world. In December, he announced that VinFast, the conglomerate\u2019s automotive group, would develop an electric vehicle and export it to the U.S. by 2021. Vuong is pledging $2 billion of his own fortune to make the improbable feat happen.Whether Americans would consider a Vietnamese car remains an open question. Ventilators, on the other hand, are a product the virus-stricken world can\u2019t turn down. \u201cThe lesson we learn from a crisis is that there will always be lots of opportunities,\u201d said Vuong. \u201cWe have to make the right choices and act fast.\u201dOver the past two decades, Vietnam has become one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies. Average annual incomes have grown more than sixfold, and even pre-pandemic, Vuong fixated on building a company fast enough to keep up with the country\u2019s growing middle class. Today the Vingroup umbrella covers dozens of businesses that touch Vietnamese from childhood through senescence.A baby can be born in a Vinmec hospital, grow up in a Vinhome, attend a Vinschool and go on to VinUniversity. A family might drive a VinFast car through a community designed by Vingroup\u2019s master planners en route to a vacation at a Vinpearl resort. In their everyday lives, they can talk on VinSmart phones and shop for international brands at Vincom malls.For Vietnam\u2019s leaders, Vuong and Vingroup are a testament to the country\u2019s progression from a socialist economy to a market-oriented one. The government has applauded Vingroup\u2019s growth and success as part of Vietnam\u2019s modernization. When VinFast\u2019s first car rolled off the assembly line, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc declared it \u201ca great day for Vietnam.\u201dWhat Vuong and Vietnam\u2019s top leaders crave is international recognition, particularly in the U.S., the country\u2019s onetime enemy and the world\u2019s biggest economy. Many Americans, Vuong acknowledges, still see Vietnam as a \u201cpoor, backward country where it\u2019s impossible to have modern and high-tech products.\u201d The successful global introduction of a Vingroup product\u2014whether it\u2019s a car or a ventilator\u2014could change the way the world sees Vietnam.\u201cWe want the company to tackle things that people think are relatively difficult, things that Vietnamese private enterprises have not done successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our mission and responsibility to develop a Vietnamese brand with a world-class reputation.\u201dVentilators may prove a strategic introduction to the global market. If Vingroup can pull off production at the scale Vuong\u2019s anticipating, it will be addressing a worldwide shortage, leveraging on Medtronic\u2019s brand as a well-established medical device maker. And if the ventilators work the way they\u2019re supposed to, Vingroup will have proven its ability to deliver a complicated, reliable, life-saving device\u2014not a bad bona fide for an aspiring carmaker.The company configured its first ventilator assembly line in less than a month, customizing three rows of conveyor belts in its seven-month-old smartphone factory. Engineers from the company\u2019s VinFast car unit worked on the design of the device, and representatives from Medtronic are advising workers who were making smartphones and TV panels a few weeks ago.\u201cThere are very few companies in the world like it,\u201d said Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP. He\u2019s been investing in Vietnam for the past decade and has private equity investments in the nation. \u201cThe ambition is astounding. It would be a huge win\u2014to make Vietnam a global player.\u201dVuong says his plans for global expansion have only been emboldened by current events. Vingroup still anticipates hiring a few hundred engineers to expand the research and design\u00a0center in Australia that will develop VinFast\u2019s next car models and EVs. The company is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of the soon-to-be-defunct Australian automaker Holden.\u201cHe seems to be zigging when other EV startups are zagging,\u201d said Michael Dunne, chief executive officer of automotive consultant ZoZo Go, which focuses on the Asian market. \u201cHe has sky-high ambitions. But then there are reality checks.\u201dVuong has echoes of another automotive titan, Dunne says: Li Shu Fu, head of China's biggest private carmaker\u00a0Geely Automotive\u00a0Holdings Ltd. Best known for acquiring Volvo from Ford in 2010, Li has become the dominant force in China\u2019s car market. And, like Vuong, he\u2019s declared his American ambitions. In 2006, he announced plans for Geely to export cars to the U.S. More than a decade later, neither Geely nor any other Chinese car brand has done so.\u00a0Vuong has steered the company through rough times before. In 2011, as Vietnam\u2019s inflation spiked to a region high of 23% and the real estate market tanked, the company\u2019s real estate unit debuted its first master-planned community, featuring luxury villas along a man-made canal. The company\u2019s consolidated net income fell 64% that year. It merged its real estate and tourism units to form Vingroup.The merger worked. Net revenue reached a record in 2012 and profits rebounded.\u00a0 Since then, revenue has grown seventeen-fold, hitting 130.8 trillion dong ($5.6 billion) in 2019. Last year, the company restructured, abandoning early plans for an airline and selling off most of its grocery stores unit as well as its agriculture business.\u201cThe ongoing businesses now are the ones with the biggest potential. We won\u2019t change our business strategy,\u201d said Vuong. \u201cIf the global recession is severe, we can adjust some of our short-term plans.\u201dVuong has the confidence of someone who\u2019s grown very rich reading and shaping consumer desires. In his earliest success, he sold Vietnamese instant soup noodles in Ukraine, where he settled after a college scholarship took him to Moscow. To convince a population raised on borscht and dumplings to love just-add-water soup, he hit the malls, did cooking demonstrations and gave away hundreds of free samples.\u201cAt the end of the day, we convinced the Ukrainian consumer,\u201d said Vuong. The business became a household staple in the Eastern European state, and Nestle SA eventually acquired it for an estimated $150 million.In 2000, Vuong returned to Vietnam with his noodle profits and found nothing but opportunity. \u201cThe infrastructure was too outdated compared to the world. Hanoi only had a few high-rise buildings and five-star hotels,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the money. If I invested and couldn\u2019t earn anything back, my thought was, at least the city would have big, nice buildings.\u201dWithin three years, he opened Vietnam\u2019s first upscale hotel, the Vinpearl Resort & Spa on Hon Tre Island, connected by a two-mile gondola to the seaside city of Nha Trang. The grounds include Vietnam\u2019s first water park and an 18-hole golf course.He started a real estate company \u2014 later merged to become Vingroup \u2014 and began building modern condominiums with supermarkets, schools and malls. Last year, the residential real estate arm sold 10,000 apartments in 17 days at its Vinhomes Grand Park, a canyon of riverside residential towers in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City.

Nonetheless, politicians\u2019 bipartisan distaste for inversions, in which U.S. companies merge with foreign firms and then take offshore tax addresses, stands to underscore the issue. Former President Barack Obama called them \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d and President Donald Trump has said they\u2019re \u201cdisgusting.\u201dAt the same time, however, tax experts, including some who strongly oppose inversions, say the Fed\u2019s guidelines are meant to help companies with large U.S. footprints, regardless of their tax-avoidance strategies.Allowing \u201cinverted\u201d companies to use the Fed\u2019s facilities makes sense because the firms are still largely American and retain U.S.-based workforces, despite their new legal addresses in places like Bermuda or Ireland, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a corporate and international taxation profession at the University of Michigan Law School.\u201cI don\u2019t see any good economic reason to exclude inverted companies,\u201d said Avi-Yonah, who has criticized inversion transactions as a tax-avoidance technique for decades. \u201cThey are just as American as other companies -- that is, in fact, the problem with inversions in the first place.\u201dEligibility GuidanceThe U.S. central bank has said it plans to enhance and update its guidance for the two bond-purchasing facilities with, among other things, \u201cissuer certification requirements.\u201d Yet the New York Fed\u2019s existing guidance says that to be eligible, a company must have \u201csignificant operations in and a majority of its employees based in the United States.\u201d That would include inverted companies.Such firms typically meet those requirements, said Robert Willens, an independent tax consultant. \u201cSo long as the inverted company uses the proceeds in the approved manner, there should be no question regarding their eligibility.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which is buying outstanding bonds and exchange traded funds, began making limited purchases Tuesday. The U.S. central bank has yet to announce a start date for the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which will provide a backstop for new debt issuance.Tax lawyers created corporate inversions in the early 1980s as a way for companies to escape what was then a 35% corporate tax rate in the U.S. The deals, which allow companies to book income offshore while retaining much of their American workforce and corporate structure, became popular in the 1990s and 2000s. But they largely stopped after the Obama administration issued regulations making inversions less profitable in 2016, and Trump signed a 21% corporate tax rate into law in 2017.More than 80 American companies, including medical device maker Medtronic Plc and insurer Everest Re Group Ltd, have effectively renounced their U.S. citizenship since 1982. Medtronic and Everest went to the low-tax jurisdictions Ireland and Bermuda, respectively.Medtronic declined to comment for this story. Everest didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.The White House has been trying to persuade companies who have left the U.S. or outsourced workers to bring back jobs, operations and assets, though success has been limited. Trump on Thursday floated levying additional taxes on companies that manufacture products outside the U.S. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, suggested on Friday cutting the 21% corporate income tax rate to 10.5% for companies that repatriate.\u201cI\u2019m a believer in rewarding, not punishing,\u201d Kudlow told reporters at the White House Friday. \u201cWhy not provide a 50% discount for the corporate tax rate if you\u2019re moving from outside the U.S. to the U.S.?\u201dQuestions PersistSome countries have taken steps to withhold virus aid from companies that practice aggressive tax avoidance. In France and Denmark, governments have said that companies operating in tax havens won\u2019t qualify for taxpayer-funded bailouts. The Fed\u2019s two corporate credit programs have a combined size of $750 billion, and and they\u2019re backed by allocations of $75 billion from the Treasury Department.In the U.S., questions regarding which firms should be able to tap portions of the massive federal bailout have persisted as the Fed, the Treasury Department and the Small Business Administration have quickly shoveled hundreds of billions of dollars into an economy largely paralyzed by Covid-19.In particular, a relief program aimed at small businesses has faced scrutiny by Congress and federal officials after the Los Angeles Lakers and publicly traded companies like Shake Shack Inc. qualified for the forgivable loans.The Fed facilities will come under closer scrutiny once they begin disclosing aid recipients. The central bank has announced plans to publish the names of participants in various facilities and such details as amounts and interest rates on its website at least every 30 days.The loans could also become an area of interest for the Congressional Oversight Commission, a bipartisan group in charge of scrutinizing the central bank\u2019s decisions.While the Cares Act doesn\u2019t explicitly require the Fed to impose restrictions such as payroll retention on companies it lends to, some members of the oversight panel expect the bank to answer to how it is helping American families.Oversight PanelIn cases where the U.S. Treasury or the Fed have broad discretion over programs, \u201cthe oversight commission has a right to ask why those decisions are being made and what the impact is of those decisions on American families,\u201d Bharat Ramamurti, a Democratic member of the panel, said in an interview with PBS.\u201cMy concern is that we seem to be helping the corporations and their creditors, which in many cases are banks, rather than the people that are actually employed by those companies,\u201d he said.That panel, however, has yet to begin much oversight work. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell haven\u2019t named a chairman to oversee it, and the group missed its first legally-mandated reporting deadline this month, raising questions about the group\u2019s nimbleness to examine what could amount to trillions in loans.Earlier this month, Ramamurti was one of the first observers to raise questions about the wisdom of letting inverted companies qualify for Fed aid. In a Twitter posting, he said the central bank\u2019s guidance \u201copens the door to providing US taxpayer support to companies that \u2018inverted.\u2019\u201dWhether to keep that door open depends on policy makers\u2019 goals, tax lawyers say.\u201cIt\u2019s a question of do you want to give relief to companies that employ U.S. workers or are these bad guys we never want to help?\u201d said Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \u201cThe Fed wants to shovel as many dollars out the door as it can. They are not being very discriminant.\u201d(Updates with Kudlow comments starting in the 14th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/firms-left-u-tax-reasons-080000864.html?.tsrc=rss"}, {"symbol": "MDT", "publishedDate": "2020-05-15 12:07:10", "title": "Are Medtronic plc\u2019s (NYSE:MDT) Returns Worth Your While?", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WA.Hu8JpvL9glwErZB_xkw--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/29c6b1c1058de012e3ef6430e32922e6", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Today we'll evaluate Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plc-nyse-mdt-returns-120710074.html?.tsrc=rss"}, {"symbol": "MDT", "publishedDate": "2020-05-15 00:00:00", "title": "CAMG Solamere Management, LLC Buys Medtronic PLC, Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc, First ...", "image": "", "site": "GuruFocus", "text": "", "url": "http://www.gurufocus.com/news/1139103/camg-solamere-management-llc-buys-medtronic-plc-midamerica-apartment-communities-inc-first-trust-low-duration-mortgage-opportunities-et-sells-huntsman-corp-sealed-air-corp-first-horizon-national-corp"}, {"symbol": "MDT", "publishedDate": "2020-05-14 16:30:04", "title": "Analysts Estimate Medtronic (MDT) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0J2ge7Ng1J6HNdPAhj0Y2g--~B/aD00NzY7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/ace7df31c7fcb10255abe7c990ea373a", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Medtronic (MDT) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report.
