That's according to Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities senior tech analyst, who said in a note to clients on Sunday that demand from China could help Tesla reach or possibly exceed it's once implausible goal of 500,000 deliveries by the end of 2020. Ives sees Tesla surging 56% from current levels to $1,000 a share in his bull case scenario. The analyst explained that Tesla has seen robust continued demand in China and if that continues in December, the EV maker could surpass its delivery target.In November, Tesla sold roughly 22,000 Model 3 vehicles in China.\u00a0 \"We believe the company is tracking to another strong month of December in China which could be the tipping point to get Musk & Co. to hit/exceed its 500k annual delivery target, an achievement not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe,\" Ives said.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-china-demand-exceed-500000-delivery-target-wedbush-ives-2020-12"}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "publishedDate": "2020-12-14 16:28:07", "title": "Vale And Tesla: The Nickel Picture", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/r/f/auto32.jpg", "site": "Seeking Alpha", "text": "Vale And Tesla: The Nickel Picture", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394688-vale-and-tesla-nickel-picture"}, {"symbol": "TSLA", "publishedDate": "2020-12-14 15:57:46", "title": "Tesla Creates UK's Largest Powerwall Installation Yet", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/t/j/tes6-2.jpg", "site": "Benzinga", "text": "While\u00a0Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA)\u00a0is often valued on the company's vehicle production, Tesla is also heavily involved in energy production and storage via solar and stationary power storage in the form of batteries.
