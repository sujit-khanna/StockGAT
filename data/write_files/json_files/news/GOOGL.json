As a judge, he's ruled that lawmakers should get the president's financial records and has sprinkled his music appreciation into opinions. \n Mehta was appointed to the court in December 2014 and sworn in in 2015. Notable rulings include one in 2019 saying that lawmakers should get their subpoenaed financial records of President Donald Trump. The Supreme Court sent that case back to a lower court and it is ongoing. He also dealt with a food-industry antitrust case early in his tenure, temporarily blocking a $3.5 billion Sysco deal for US Foods after regulators opposed the deal. The companies scrapped it days later. \n He's a hip-hop lover, according to his judicial writings. In a footnote to a 2015 opinion involving a copyright claim, the judge said he did not need expert testimony to determine that two songs were \"not substantially similar\" because he was not \"an ordinary 'lay person' when it comes to hip-hop music and lyrics,\" having \"listened to hip hop for decades\" and counting among his favorites Jay Z, Kanye West, Drake and Eminem. He also cited lyrics from the Beyonc\u00e9 song \"Sorry,\" from her classic album \"Lemonade,\" in a 2018 opinion on another copyright case. \n He had previously been a lawyer focused on criminal defense and business disputes for a D.C. law firm, Zuckerman Spaeder, where he represented clients such as the former head of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, in a...", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Meet-Amit-Mehta-the-judge-for-Google-s-antitrust-15665183.php"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 20:09:01", "title": "Former Google CEO Fires Back at Justice Department's Antitrust Suit | MarketScreener", "image": "https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdblanc.png", "site": "https://www.marketscreener.com", "text": "", "url": "https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ALPHABET-INC-24203373/news/Former-Google-CEO-Fires-Back-at-Justice-Department-s-Antitrust-Suit-31585362/"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 20:06:38", "title": "Opinion | Republicans\u2019 antitrust lawsuit misses the real problems with Google\u2019s power", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3LUMVFQT2UI6XLLPG3ET43UU7M.jpg&w=1440", "site": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "text": "The merits of the Justice Department\u2019s case suggest a rush job.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-antitrust-lawsuit-misses-the-real-problems-with-googles-power/2020/10/21/c00bd30c-13c7-11eb-ad6f-36c93e6e94fb_story.html"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 19:59:08", "title": "Artificial intelligence and the antitrust case against Google", "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/googlereuters.jpeg?w=1200&strip=all", "site": "https://markets.businessinsider.com", "text": "Federal prosecutors say Google uses anticompetitive business practices as well as artificial intelligence, data, and scale to maintain monopolies.", "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/artificial-intelligence-and-the-antitrust-case-against-google-9418572"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 19:56:04", "title": "Rhode Island to Launch Virtual Career Center powered by Google Cloud as part of \"Back to Work RI\" Initiative", "image": "https://www.ri.gov/img/ios/touch-icon-iphone4.png", "site": "https://www.einpresswire.com", "text": "Rhode Island's Virtual Career Center will connect thousands of residents with jobs to match their skills, and return to work after being displaced by COVID-19", "url": "https://www.einpresswire.com/article/528925474/rhode-island-to-launch-virtual-career-center-powered-by-google-cloud-as-part-of-back-to-work-ri-initiative"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 19:55:03", "title": "If Google's a monopoly, who is harmed by its market power?", "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/14/24/07/20005332/29/rawImage.jpg", "site": "https://www.sfchronicle.com", "text": "Google has long defended itself against charges of monopoly by stressing that its products are free and that no one has to use them.

Advertisers are its real customers. That complicates the question of who, if anyone, is hurt by Google's dominance in selling ads off the world's search queries and through its array of affiliated businesses, from its Android phone software to its YouTube video platform and digital maps.

But it treads on ground already broken years before by EU officials in Brussels. \n Veterans of Europe's antitrust tech battles welcomed the U.S. investigation and said American authorities should learn from the bloc's experience. \n \"We hope U.S. authorities have paid attention to two major drawbacks of the EU investigations: the long-drawn-out process and Google's tactics to use any loophole to avoid changing its business model,\" said BEUC, a European consumer group that was a complainant to one of the EU's Google cases, involving its shopping service. \n The EU's competition commissioner, Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, has slapped Google with multibillion dollar penalties in three separate competition cases in recent years. The eye-popping fines put Vestager at the forefront of the global movement to rein in Big Tech companies. \n But critics say - and Vestager has acknowledged - that they haven't done much to change the company's behavior and have taken too long to be enforced. As a result, EU officials in Brussels are weighing up new rules and tools. \n U.S. officials indicated in their lawsuit filed Tuesday that they wanted to go beyond EU-style headline-grabbing fines, which Google can easily afford, and mandating deeper changes to company practices. They asked a court to consider structural relief to remedy any competitive harm - language that suggests a possible break-up of the company. \n One key takeaway from the EU's experience is that the slow pace of antitrust investigations, lawsuits and...", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/US-antitrust-crackdown-on-Google-echoes-Europe-s-15663503.php"}, {"symbol": "GOOGL", "publishedDate": "2020-10-21 15:33:01", "title": "Europe's Antitrust Push Against Google Hasn't Dented Its Heft.
