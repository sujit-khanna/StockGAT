The plan involves spending $20 billion to build two new chip factories in Arizona, where Intel will manufacture its own chips and act as a \"foundry,\" or manufacturing partner, for third party chip designers. Bryson said that while Intel's course of action is largely ideal, it will be costly and time consuming and a drag on the stock. For example, Intel is building its first 7 nanometer chip, but it won't be shipped until 2023, later than the company previously suggested. The analyst has a 12 month price target of $53 for Intel, a roughly 15% drop from current levels.\u00a0 Bryson also holds an \"underperform\" rating for Intel.

SK Hynix said the companies expect to get required governmental approvals for the deal by late 2021. \n The transaction, if completed, could reportedly make SK Hynix the world's second-largest provider of NAND flash memory chips behind Samsung Electronics, another South Korean chip giant. \n Demand for flash memory has strengthened in recent months due to buying of personal computers and servers as the coronavirus pandemic forces millions to work from home. \n Intel said it plans to invest proceeds from the transaction into advancing long-growth priorities, including technologies related to artificial intelligence and fifth-generation wireless networks. \n \"This transaction will allow us to further prioritize our investments in differentiated technology where we can play a bigger role in the success of our customers and deliver attractive returns to our stockholders,\" Bob Swan, Intel's CEO, said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Intel-to-sell-NAND-business-to-SKorean-rival-for-15659999.php"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 08:24:03", "title": "INTEL CORP : JP Morgan reiterates its Buy rating | MarketScreener", "image": "https://www.marketscreener.com/images/twitter_MS_fdgris.png", "site": "https://www.marketscreener.com", "text": "", "url": "https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/INTEL-CORPORATION-4829/news/INTEL-CORP-JP-Morgan-reiterates-its-Buy-rating-31571775/"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 07:55:00", "title": "Intel poised to sell NAND business to South Korea's SK Hynix for almost $10 bln", "image": "https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/10/20/905274.JPG", "site": "https://www.thestar.com.my", "text": "Intel Corp is preparing to sell its NAND memory chip business to SK Hynix Inc for almost $10 billion in a deal that would propel the South Korean chipmaker to second in the global rankings, two sources familiar with the matter said.", "url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/10/20/intel-poised-to-sell-nand-business-to-south-korea039s-sk-hynix-for-almost-10-bln"}, {"symbol": "INTC", "publishedDate": "2020-10-20 07:20:49", "title": "Intel agrees to sell storage unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/10/SK-Hynix.jpg", "site": "https://indianexpress.com", "text": "Intel has said for months it was exploring options for the flash group.
