In a note published Tuesday, BofA increased its price objectives on banks by 11%, outlining a 21% implied upside for larger companies and a 20% upside for small and mid-cap banks. It pointed out that the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has gained more than 50% since early November when Pfizer announced the creation of a coronavirus vaccine and is up about 20% so far in 2021. \"[But] we think the sector has room to run,\" said BofA.\u00a0 Among the calls, the target on JPMorgan Chase shares was pushed up to $181 from $163, with a potential gain of 20% from Monday's close at just below $151. The \"economic recovery is fast gaining steam, and will be likely turbocharged by the recently passed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan,\" said BofA analysts led by Erika Najarian in a note about the higher price objectives. Also, BofA's rates strategists have upwardly revised their year-end forecast on the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.15% from 1.75%.\u00a0 The US government has been sending $1,400 checks to most Americans as part of the stimulus package. Bank of America foresees 2021 economic growth of 6.5% with an upward bias. Meanwhile, investors pricing in the potential for hotter inflation stoked by economic growth have propelled the 10-year yield to 14-month highs, past 1.7%. The 10-year yield and other long-dated Treasury yields are tied to mortgages, auto loans and other lending programs and banks can earn more from loans as those rates increase. Wells Fargo's price objective was lifted to $43 from $39, indicating a 10% increase from Monday's settlement \u00a0Citigroup's target was unchanged at $100 but still implies a 39% gain.\u00a0 BofA said banks during recent conversations ahead of their quiet period before earnings, \"suggest a continued upward bias to consensus estimates,\" even though there are expectations for \"softer net interest income trends\" in the first quarter.

Despite the U.S. decision, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Fox Business that talks with China continue on various levels.The restrictions are likely to further hit both Huawei\u2019s 5G base stations and smartphone businesses because it relies heavily on foreign chips to make those, further denting China\u2019s ambition to play a key role in global rollout of 5G technology. Huawei\u2019s stockpiles of certain self-designed chips essential to telecom equipment will run out by early 2021.Nokia Oyj and Ericsson AB stand to benefit from Huawei\u2019s further faltering in its 5G prowess, while domestic smartphone rivals including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo are likely to get a bigger pie of the Chinese market.Ross said the action was aimed at closing loopholes the company explored after previous U.S. actions. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo praised the move as a \u201cdirect blow\u201d against the Chinese Communist Party.The company has long rejected accusations that its technology can be used to spy on foreign nations or companies.All chip companies working for Huawei, no matter where they are, will be subject to licenses, a Commercial official said, adding that even foreign companies will be affected as long as they use U.S. design software and equipment.That means major Asian and European chip companies such as MediaTek Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., NXP Semiconductors NV, and STMicroelectronics NV may need a license to continue shipping to Huawei, though the official declined to name any specific company.There are few semiconductor companies in the world, including those in China, that do not rely on software from U.S.-based Synopsys Inc. and Cadence Design Systems Inc. to create blueprints for chips. Many companies that make physical chips, including China\u2019s own Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., use equipment from U.S.-based Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Reserach Corp. European ChipmakersAmong Synopsys and Cadence\u2019s customers, Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek has become a main chip provider to Huawei after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it will no longer ship chips to the Chinese company after Sept. 15. That\u2019s due to the U.S.\u2019s export-control rules added in May, which forbade companies from making chips based on Huawei\u2019s design using American equipment.The latest U.S. restrictions on Huawei are negative for European chipmakers, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said in a note, adding that a key risk for firms such as STMicroelectronics, AMS AG and Dialog Semiconductor PLC is Chinese retaliatory restrictions on major customer Apple Inc.Additionally, assemblers that incorporate Huawei or third-party chips into their devices for the benefit of Huawei will also need to apply for a license, according to the Commerce official. That means Huawei smartphones assemblers, including Hong Kong-listed Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd., may be restricted by the new rules.(Updates with comment from Commerce Department in ninth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-announces-curbs-huawei-access-160022752.html"}, {"symbol": "JPM", "publishedDate": "2020-08-17 14:39:00", "title": "JPMorgan hires UK ex-finance minister Javid", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/m/0/m02d20200817t2i1529950143w940fhfwllplsqrlynxnpeg7g1bi.jpg", "site": "Reuters", "text": "Wall Street giant JPMorgan has hired Britain's former finance minister Sajid Javid as a senior adviser, the bank said on Monday, a move that sees the politician resume his career in investment banking.", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-javid/jpmorgan-hires-uk-ex-finance-minister-javid-idUSKCN25D2BA"}, {"symbol": "JPM", "publishedDate": "2020-08-17 14:12:00", "title": "Barrick Gold Is Surging \u2014Just Don\u2019t Thank Warren Buffett", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "There\u2019s a good chance that the stake came from either Ted Weschler or Todd Combs, Buffett\u2019s investment lieutenants.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/069359f4-2a5a-35b2-b91d-2c236068ce06/barrick-gold-is-surging-%E2%80%94just.html"}, {"symbol": "JPM", "publishedDate": "2020-08-17 12:46:22", "title": "Student loans may be needed now more than ever.

Gold", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Dumping bank shares and investing in a gold miner? It certainly doesn\u2019t sound like a Warren Buffett move, but that\u2019s exactly what the investing guru\u2019s company did in the second quarter, according to a regulatory disclosure Friday. It\u2019s\u00a0not a good sign for markets.\u00a0Buffett, the fifth-richest person in the world, has loved few things more in his life than sweets, soda and compound interest \u2014\u00a0but banking stocks have come pretty close. Buffett was there to boost them during and after the last crisis, and he\u2019s remained a top shareholder in most of the big U.S. banks.\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s so jarring\u00a0that Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold 62% of its stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co. and cut 26% of its Wells Fargo & Co. holdings last period amid the Covid-19 crisis. The\u00a0conglomerate also pared back positions in other financial-services firms including PNC Financial Services Group Inc., M&T Bank Corp.,\u00a0Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. Berkshire all but exited Goldman Sachs in the first quarter \u2014\u00a0in the first of Buffett\u2019s\u00a0worrying signals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and finished the deed\u00a0in the second.\u00a0Berkshire also did away with its leftover airline positions \u2014 a move\u00a0Buffett previously disclosed \u2014\u00a0and a stake in Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. Perhaps most telling was that Berkshire\u2019s only new purchase was Barrick Gold Corp., a gold-mining giant. The\u00a0stake is now valued at about $605 million, which is still\u00a0relatively puny as far as Berkshire holdings go. Selling bank stocks when\u00a0interest rates are low and are expected to stay that way isn\u2019t a contrarian idea,\u00a0but a bet on gold is an act of fear\u00a0and not something expected from\u00a0an experienced investor who has ridden out numerous downturns as Buffett has in his nearly 90 years\u00a0(his milestone birthday is later this month). Buffett has even ridiculed gold hoarders in the past. Here\u2019s a lesson he gave at the May 2018 annual Berkshire investor meeting:Let's say you've taken $10,000 and you\u00a0listen to the prophets of doom and gloom around you \u2014 and you'll get that constantly throughout your life. And instead, you use the $10,000 to buy gold. Now, for your $10,000 you would have been able to buy about 300 ounces of gold. And while the businesses were reinvesting in more plants and new inventions came along, you would get down every year and you look in your safe deposit box and you'd have your 300 ounces of gold. And you could look at it and you could fondle it and you could, I mean, whatever you wanted to do with it. But it didn't produce anything. It was never going to produce anything. And what would you have today? You would have 300 ounces of gold just like you had in March of 1942.Now, Buffett isn\u2019t stacking gold bars in his basement, but he\u2019s\u00a0still wagering on the precious metal. Berkshire\u2019s top five investments remained unchanged: Apple Inc., Bank of America Corp., Coca-Cola Co., American Express Inc. and Kraft Heinz Co.; however, it has been buying more Bank of America shares in recent weeks, which are too recent to show up in Friday\u2019s filing. Apple now accounts for nearly half the value of Berkshire\u2019s $221\u00a0billion equity portfolio\u00a0and is performing much better than Berkshire itself. Buffett used to joke that he\u2019s \u201cone-quarter Coca-Cola,\u201d but he can switch that to Apple now.To be fair, it\u2019s not clear who exactly made these investing decisions, a responsibility Buffett shares with Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, his stock-picking\u00a0deputies. Either way, Berkshire sold about $13 billion of stocks when one would expect Buffett, a stalwart believer in the U.S. economy, to go\u00a0on a buying spree. It\u2019s not as if\u00a0Berkshire needs the cash \u2014\u00a0it had a mind-boggling $147 billion as of June.As I wrote last week, it would help in times like these if Buffett held quarterly earnings calls to get a better understanding of his frame of mind. The last time investors heard from him was the virtual shareholder meeting in May, during which he said:\u00a0\u201cNothing can stop America.\u201d It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t believe that any longer, but these latest moves \u2014\u00a0hoarding cash and finding gold-mining attractive \u2014\u00a0suggest he sees the crisis lasting longer and perhaps getting worse before it gets better. No one knows whether that will be the case, but Buffett has his finger on the pulse of the economy by way of all the various industries Berkshire operates in:\u00a0from freight railroads to airplane parts, insurance policies to car dealerships, bricks for home construction to Fruit of the Loom underwear, industrial chemicals to Dairy Queen fast food, jewelry stores to private jets and much more.\u00a0For Buffett\u2019s big birthday, I had thought he\u2019d want a big acquisition \u2014\u00a0the elusive \u201celephant\u201d he\u2019s talked of for so long. But maybe just ship some bullion bars to Omaha instead.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

Berkshire's moves appeared to reflect a broad lightening of the conglomerates exposure to large-capitalization banks during the worst public health crisis in generations. Berkshire sold 85.6 million shares of Wells Fargo, representing about 26% of its stake and putting its ownership to about 3% from 5.3%. The insurance conglomerate also shed 35.5 million shares of JPMorgan, 61% of its position, which now represents 1% of Berkshire's overall portfolio from 3% in the prior period.
