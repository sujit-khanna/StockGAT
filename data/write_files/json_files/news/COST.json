(NASDAQ: COST) rose by 10.79% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Costco Wholesale has.Costco Wholesale's Debt Based on Costco Wholesale's balance sheet as of June 4, 2020, long-term debt is at $7.60 billion and current debt is at $1.50 billion, amounting to $9.10 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $10.83 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $-1.73 billion.Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Costco Wholesale has $51.73 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.18. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than 1 means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry, whereas average for another.Why Investors Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations.See more from Benzinga  * ROCE Insights For Costco Wholesale  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Costco Wholesale  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

This is a long-term winner, and today's weakness will ultimately look like little more than a blip on the radar in five years.Here's a deeper look. The Burgeoning E-Commerce Platform MarketTo understand the long-term bull thesis on companies like BigCommerce and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), you need to understand the bull thesis on the broader e-commerce platform market.Long story short, all the big dogs in the retail world - like Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Target (NYSE:TGT) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) - have already built out robust e-commerce platforms. Small retailers haven't. As of 2018, around 40% of small businesses didn't even have a website, mostly because e-commerce has remained relatively niche.Not anymore.Thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic, consumer adoption of e-commerce has permanently accelerated. E-commerce is no longer niche. It's everywhere and everything.So, what you have started to see in 2020, is small and mid-sized businesses swarm to e-commerce. This trend won't slow down. Over the next decade, it will accelerate, to the point where websites will become the new storefronts, in that every retailer will have one by 2030, and most retailers will be doing most of their business through them by then.But, building a robust e-commerce operation isn't easy. You have to build a website and optimize it from a design, sales and marketing perspective. You have to build out sales capability in social channels, leverage data to increase conversions, employ digital marketing campaigns to drive traffic, so on and so forth.These small and mid-sized businesses are flocking to e-commerce platform companies, like Shopify and BigCommerce, to help them build strong e-retail businesses.This flocking will remain vigorous over the next decade. As it does, the amount of money flowing through these e-commerce platforms - both subscription dollars and marketplace dollars - will soar. BigCommerce Is a Strong Company in a Strong MarketFor all intents and purposes, Shopify is the king of the e-commerce platform market. With 1.05 million merchants and $61 billion in gross merchandise value, Shopify is simply miles bigger than everyone else in the space.But this isn't a winner-take-all market.Of all the small and mid-sized businesses that will rush into e-commerce platforms over the next decade, not all of them will choose Shopify, simply because there are other platforms out there that offer different features which may appeal more to different sellers.The strongest of the \"other guys\" in this market is BigCommerce.BigCommerce has a solid positioning in this market, powering 60,000-plus online stores as of June 2020. But, more importantly, BigCommerce has enough distinct advantages over Shopify in certain areas that the platform is a better option than Shopify for many sellers.For example, BigCommerce features zero transaction fees, whereas Shopify takes a 0.5% to 2% commission off every transaction. Plus, BigCommerce has far more robust product listing options, more APIs, better multi-currency solutions, tiered pricing structures and more streamlined customer upload options.To that end, BigCommerce is often a more attractive option than Shopify for many smaller sellers, international sellers, bulk discount sellers, retail shops with a ton of SKUs or personalized items, so on and so forth.In other words, BigCommerce reasonably projects as a solid second-fiddle to Shopify in the burgeoning e-commerce platform market.On that basis alone, BigCommerce stock looks like a compelling long-term buy. BigCommerce Stock Has Upside PotentialBigCommerce has a $5 billion market cap. Shopify has a $120 billion market cap.I'm not drawing this comparison to say that BigCommerce could one day be a $100+ billion company. It won't be, partly because BigCommerce won't ever have as many merchants as Shopify. And partly because BigCommerce doesn't make any revenue off of marketplace sales, whereas that is Shopify's biggest revenue stream.But I am drawing this comparison to show that BIGC stock does have significant long-term upside potential.BigCommerce powered 60,000 online stores as of June 2020. There are 7.1 million e-retailers in the world. So, BigCommerce powers about 1% of e-retail websites in the world today.About 74% of small retailers don't have an e-commerce enabled website. Thus, we can estimate the total number of retailers in the world at 27 million. By 2030, I think most of those retailers will have an e-commerce presence. If hat number's 80%, the total e-retailer pool would be 22 million.Let's say BigCommerce maintains 1% market share. Total online stores powered by BigCommerce will measure 220,000 by the end of the decade.Using 2019 numbers, BigCommerce made about $2,000 per year off of each one of its online stores.  That number will rise over time, thanks to price hikes and more bigger sellers on the platform (who have higher subscription price points). BigCommerce's unit revenues could easily rise to $4,000 to $5,000 by 2030.The math there implies nearly $1 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. Gross margins are around 75%. The opex rate should fall with scale towards an application software industry-average opex rate of 40%. So, you're talking 35% operating margins, $350 million in operating profits, and potentially $280 million in 2030 net profits after taking out 20% for taxes.Application software stocks typically fetch a 35x forward earnings multiple. A 35x multiple on $280 million in 2030 net profits implies a potential 2029 market cap for BIGC stock of nearly $10 billion.That's about double today's market cap, with room for upside if BigCommerce expands market share in the e-commerce platform market. Bottom Line on BIGC StockBigCommerce stock is a long-term winner.Sure, the IPO hype didn't last long. Don't worry about that. This is all just near-term noise.Let the hype fade. Let the traders flip the stock. Then, step in, buy the dip and hold for the long haul as secular e-commerce platform tailwinds push BIGC stock way higher in the long run.Luke Lango is a Markets Analyst for InvestorPlace.

As a hardware and home maintenance retailer, Home Depot is a needed commodity in any market, bull or bear. This resiliency underlining Home Depot stock has proven itself yet again during the novel coronavirus pandemic.Source: Cassiohabib / Shutterstock.com Sure, people flocked to Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) stores when the coronavirus first struck and it made sense: you can't live without food, water, and convenient hand sanitizer packages.However, many of us - including yours truly - discovered that items that we necessarily can't eat nevertheless play a vital role in our comfort and in a real sense, our safety.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsTherefore, I haven't been surprised that Home Depot stock has steadily marched higher since its March lows. But ahead of its second-quarter earnings report, it's fair to consider the other side of the coin.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListYes, HD received a shot of relevancy during the peak of this crisis. As well, other potential crises - particularly the record-breaking hurricane season - should theoretically lift Home Depot stock. But back in March, people had more money to work with. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to exact a toll on our country, those collective funds have been negatively impacted.Further, the deadlock in Congress about extending pandemic-related relief to millions of desperate Americans raise concern, not only for Home Depot stock but for other retail names. At one point, many workers were making more money staying at home than they did actually working. Surely, this supported consumer spending.Now, without that vital support, a dark cloud hangs over the labor force. It's not as if every HD customer is well off. Unusual Housing Dynamics for Home Depot StockObviously, with a name like Home Depot stock, the security moves on major developments in the housing market. In this case, HD generally moves higher when it's a seller's market. This makes sense because higher home prices indicate greater demand, which in turn benefits HD's valuation.Of course, this trend has its limits. If there is too much demand, meaning that inventory is constrained, the shift toward HD wouldn't be sustainable. A classic example is the housing crisis which eventually led to the Great Recession.Further, between 2012 to 2018, the price of Home Depot stock shared a strong direct correlation with the monthly supply of houses in the U.S. (which the government measures as the ratio of houses for sale versus houses sold). In other words, as home supply increased (to reasonable levels), so too did HD shares.But from the beginning of 2019, we saw an abrupt change to this relationship. Instead of a direct correlation, we now have an inverse relationship: as one metric goes up, the other slides down. Nowhere is this new dynamic more evident than it is during this crisis.  Click to EnlargeSource: Chart by Josh Enomoto In April, the housing supply ratio jumped to 6.8, a multi-year high. At the time, Home Depot stock averaged $218.53. Jump ahead to June and the housing supply is down to 4.7 and HD shares traded at $249.This tells me that demand for home furnishings, repair and remodeling is strong - with a dearth of inventory, what else are current homeowners going to do?Looking back at history, until the housing supply ratio reaches unsustainable levels, perhaps at ratios seen during the last housing crisis, the bullishness in HD stock will likely continue. Again, there's really nothing that prospective home buyers can do. Divisive Politics Can Be a Surprising CatalystStill, the big wildcard is the economy. Unless the U.S. government can get its act together and present viable solutions, we may face a catastrophe. You only need to look at the rising prices of precious metals to understand the fear investors have.As well, the political divisiveness isn't helping matters. But on some levels, it's a positive catalyst for Home Depot stock. Primarily, President Donald Trump has every incentive to throw anything and everything at the struggling economy. If it's sickly by election day, he's toast and he knows it.On the other hand, Wall Street seems to have a love affair with the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris ticket. Thus, even if Trump loses, that could also be positive for HD stock.Given the strange dynamics of the new normal, I'd say that Home Depot looks good into 2021. And even if disaster strikes again, it's reasonable to have confidence in HD. It's been proven reliable during the worst of times and hopefully, this pandemic should prove no different.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed in a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth in a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share for shareholders in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Costco Wholesale posted an ROCE of 0.07%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on COSTROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Costco Wholesale is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.In Costco Wholesale's case, the positive ROCE ratio will be something investors pay attention to before making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Recap Costco Wholesale reported Q3 earnings per share at $1.89/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $2.04/share.See more from Benzinga  * Unusual Options Activity Insight: Costco Wholesale  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The stock price moved up to $336.69 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: PUT  * Expiration Date: 2020-09-11  * Strike Price: $320.00  * Volume: 391  * Open Interest: 583 Signs of Unusual Options Activity One way options activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally high. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, are called open interest. These contracts are not closed because a buyer has not purchased a contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.\"Out of the money\" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. \"Out of the money\" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Thursday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Wednesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

But when virus-spooked Americans began avoiding\u00a0stores earlier this year and shifting spending online, far more Walmart customers went to Amazon.com Inc.\u00a0than Walmart.com.So even though Walmart, too, has thrived as an essential service amid the pandemic, Amazon is benefiting more.In the first week of February, for every dollar shoppers spent with the two rivals, 66 cents went to Walmart and 34 cents to Amazon, according to Facteus, which tracks credit and debit-card spending for\u00a0millions of shoppers. In the first week of August, that gap narrowed to 55\u00a0cents to Walmart and 45 cents to Amazon.\u00a0Walmart, through a spokesman, declined to comment.When the coronavirus began spreading across the the U.S., Amazon stumbled at first. Shipping times lengthened; multiple products were out of stock. Some reports said the company\u2019s vaunted customer\u00a0service metrics were starting to slip.\u00a0Amazon responded by hiring 175,000 people to keep its operations running as existing employees sickened or stayed away for fear of catching Covid-19.The strategy, which included stepped-up safety measures in warehouses,\u00a0eased investors\u2019 fears. But few predicted the second-quarter earnings report that\u00a0shattered\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s already optimistic expectations\u00a0and forecast a continued surge in demand even as stores start to re-open. The shares\u00a0have advanced more than 65% this year, compared with a 3% gain for the S&P 500.Turns out the online retail giant was perfectly situated\u00a0to take advantage of a sudden shift in consumer behavior that, according to McKinsey, has compressed 10 years\u00a0worth of online sales growth into three months.\u00a0Amazon\u2019s\u00a0easily searchable website packed with hundreds of millions of products that can be delivered\u00a0from warehouses scattered across the country stood out more than ever when the malls and Main Street went dark. And shoppers suddenly became quite forgiving of delivery delays.\u00a0More than 8 in 10 thought holdups of a few days or longer were reasonable given the outbreak, according to a survey of 500 Amazon consumers conducted in June by\u00a0Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Goat Consulting.As always, consumers are mostly mission-shopping at Amazon\u2014hitting the site with a list that now includes everything from hand wipes and masks to above-ground pools and home-office furniture. But another trend has emerged too. People who once trolled the mall with no particular product in mind\u00a0are starting to do the same on Amazon, which hasn't previously been known for window shopping. Consider the surge in demand for\u00a0shelves shaped like coffins\u00a0and gigantic stuffed panthers\u2014classic retail therapy for a panicked populace.\u201cRather than price-compare or look for alternatives, a large portion of the U.S. population\u2014as well as in other core Amazon markets\u2014defaulted to Amazon,\u201d says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, a\u00a0New York research firm that monitors the site. \u201cThey were able to default to Amazon because of its vast selection, so even as people went from shopping for masks to toilet paper to webcams to dumbbells to inflatable pools and back, Amazon had it. It\u2019s not that other retailers didn\u2019t have the same products at similar prices. The key was that customers didn\u2019t look elsewhere.\u201dOf course, other retailers\u00a0allowed to stay open throughout the pandemic have benefited, too.\u00a0Walmart, Target Corp. and\u00a0Costco Wholesale Corp. have\u00a0all gobbled up sales lost by shuttered stores, allowing them to grow even when consumers cut overall spending in response to rising joblessness and a tenuous economy. But Amazon has outperformed them all. Its website\u00a0attracted 2.57\u00a0billion visitors in July, more than EBay Inc., Walmart, Etsy, Home Depot, Target and Best Buy\u00a0combined, according to Marketplace Pulse.Amazon has become a substitute for entire industries. Foodies turned to it for new kitchen appliances after their favorite restaurants closed. Hair dye sales surged because people couldn\u2019t go to salons.\u00a0Many Americans are finally starting that garden since they have nothing else to do. All of these factors combined to propel second-quarter sales\u00a040%\u00a0 to $88.9\u00a0billion.The big question for investors is whether Amazon\u2019s sales spike will endure. The economy is still struggling, and it doesn't help that Congress is deadlocked on a fresh round of stimulus spending and an extension of unemployment benefits. There\u2019s also little doubt that some of the buying on Amazon and elsewhere is related to the pandemic and could fade.\u00a0In a survey of 1,000 U.S. shoppers\u00a0conducted last week, more than half\u00a0said they\u2019ve made online purchases as a way to relieve stress, says\u00a0Vivek Pandya, Senior Digital Insights Manager at Adobe Digital Insights.That could explain the strong demand for those coffin-shaped shelves, which are sold as a kind of gag by\u00a0Helium 10, an Irvine, California-based company that makes e-commerce tools. Ditto for the spike in sales of giant stuffed animals.\u00a0 \u201cWhether people are just looking for something large and comforting during these uncertain times or\u00a0they\u2019re just bored and think a giant panther would look good in that empty space in their living room, I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Macy Frazier, an operations analyst at Viahart, the\u00a0Canton, Texas-based merchant that sells them. \u201cThere\u2019s just something going on.\"Retail therapy exists in good times as well as bad. And when the pandemic ends, Amazon will inherit a landscape decimated by dozens of retail bankruptcies, including department store chain J.C. Penney Co., clothing retailer Lord & Taylor, furniture and housewares seller Pier 1 Imports Inc. and\u00a0Modell\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. It\u2019s telling\u2014and a potentially ominous sign\u00a0for these retailers\u2014that Amazon\u2019s subscription services surged 30% last quarter. Most of that is new Prime members, who will be hard to dislodge once the\u00a0battered chains emerge from Chapter 11\u00a0with fewer stores.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-wins-loyal-walmart-shoppers-100004459.html"}, {"symbol": "COST", "publishedDate": "2020-08-12 08:49:00", "title": "5 Retail Stocks Set to Pull Off a Beat This Earnings Season", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/b/q/specialty14.jpg", "site": "Zacks Investment Research", "text": "Retailers dealing in food and other household products are likely to have benefited from consumers' shift in buying behavior and spending pattern due to the pandemic.", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1040267/5-retail-stocks-set-to-pull-off-a-beat-this-earnings-season"}, {"symbol": "COST", "publishedDate": "2020-08-11 21:25:41", "title": "New inflation figures are expected to be tame, though investors are betting it's about to pick up", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106658983-1597172053278-gettyimages-1264144832-l1003432.jpeg?v=1597172112", "site": "cnbc", "text": "Some investors are betting that the Covid-19 economic recovery will bring something the return from the financial crisis never did - inflation.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/new-inflation-figures-are-expected-to-be-tame-though-investors-are-betting-its-about-to-pick-up.html"}, {"symbol": "COST", "publishedDate": "2020-08-11 16:49:00", "title": "Charting the approach of record highs, S&P 500 rises amid market rotation", "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IM234_spx081_MD_20200811121537.jpg", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks\u2019 already-bullish backdrop has strengthened amid rotational August price action, writes Michael Ashbaugh.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/charting-the-approach-of-record-highs-sp-500-rises-amid-market-rotation-2020-08-11-121034540"}, {"symbol": "COST", "publishedDate": "2020-08-11 16:34:09", "title": "Casper CEO: &#39;We are marching our way into profitability very quickly&#39;", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Casper co-founder and CEO Phil Krim weighs in on the company's outlook in an interview with Yahoo Finance.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/casper-earnings-q2-2020-163409417.html"}, {"symbol": "COST", "publishedDate": "2020-08-10 16:20:01", "title": "Dow Jones Jumps 275 Points On Trump Executive Orders; Apple Gets Price-Target Hikes, While Nike Is Breaking Out Today", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "The major stock indexes were mixed on President Trump's executive orders on extending unemployment benefits.

No more. It opens for trade on Aug. 7 at about $35 a share. That's a 21% gain for 2020, against 2.3% for the S&P 500 index, and 11% for Walmart (NYSE:WMT), the country's biggest grocer.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Kroger operates under dozens of brands, from Fred Meyer in Portland to Ralph's in Los Angeles, and from King Soopers in Denver to Harris Teeter in North Carolina. As a result, most people don't realize it's America's second-biggest grocery chain, with 10% of the U.S. market. Its share is twice that of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), which has 5%, and five times that of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Whole Foods, at 2%.Thanks to the virus, this fact has gotten through investors' heads and made Kroger a hot stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Hot CompanyDuring the April quarter this also made Kroger a hot company. Sales zoomed to $41.55 billion. That's a gain of 11.5% over the same quarter of 2019. Profits also rose sharply, to $1.54 per share, up from 95 cents a year earlier.Can it do that again? The spring quarter is usually Kroger's best. Analysts are only expecting revenue of $29.3 billion when Kroger next reports earnings Sept. 17. That would still be 5% ahead of last year. Net income is expected to be 50 cents per share, up from 37 cents last year.Kroger has gone from being the forgotten store of the middle class to essential during the pandemic. The center of the market, where packaged goods like canned meat, cereal, and ketchup are located, has gone from cold to hot as well.The virus also has the media talking about Kroger again, often in the same breath as Walmart. Kroger has been bottling its own milk for years, a trend that has destroyed dairy aisle \"name brands\" like Dean Foods and Borden.  Suddenly, the media notices.  * 7 Travel Stocks to Buy Banking On Pent-Up Demand When talking about mask requirements, Kroger is also being mentioned in the same breath as Walmart. The same is true with the coin shortage. Kroger had always been there. It's just being noticed now. After the PandemicThe question for investors is, what happens after the pandemic passes? Will Kroger go back to being the forgotten home of the forgotten middle class?That depends on what the grocer does now.Kroger didn't bring out its first unified brand message until late last year. It's now combining all advertising under a single national team, which will handle all channels, and all Kroger brands. This includes streaming and internet-based ads, where Kroger data is being used to target ads on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) streaming boxes.More controversial are Kroger's plans for home delivery. These still focus on automated warehouses from Ocado Group (OTCMKTS:OCDDY), a British company it partnered with two years ago. It's a contrast to Walmart, which has been handling online fulfillment directly through its stores. Kroger stores do pick-up, too. They just don't do it as well. They also don't do it profitably. Ocado warehouses are designed to do it profitably. The Bottom Line on Kroger StockI spent much of last year pounding the table for Kroger stock, writing that it wasn't being appreciated and praised the Ocado deal. This was thanks to Kroger's performance through the 2010s. It still trades for 10% less than it did five years ago. From a high of $41 a share in late 2015 it fell to a low of $20 in 2017.Now it's closer to fair value. The price-to-earnings ratio is 13.5, and the 18 cents per share dividend yields 2.05%. Whether its pandemic gains are temporary or permanent is still unknown, but the slow-motion turnaround looks real.Dana Blankenhorn has been a financial and technology journalist since 1978.

Let\u2019s Hope So", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Politics have been getting in the way of Americans broadly adopting a crucial preventative health measure: Wearing a mask in public to curb the spread of Covid-19. Now, though, the experts that have been urging that practice have an enormously powerful ally in Walmart Inc.The big-box retailing giant said Wednesday it would require customers\u00a0at\u00a0its eponymous stores and\u00a0Sam\u2019s Club chain to wear face coverings. While some 65% of its locations were already doing this to comply with local regulations, it will make it mandatory at all stores nationwide beginning July 20.\u00a0\u00a0Walmart does not get any credit for leading the industry on this, given that Costco Wholesale Corp., Best Buy Co. and Starbucks Corp. had earlier moved in this direction. Still, it was certainly the right thing to do because it\u00a0will\u00a0go a long way toward protecting its customers and the 1.5 million employees of its U.S. stores. And because of Walmart\u2019s ubiquity\u00a0and its outsize influence in American shopping, its embrace of the policy could be a hugely important step\u00a0toward getting mask-wearing to be a routine behavior in all sorts of public domains.\u00a0Walmart stores are often located in rural areas, which have only recently started to\u00a0see a surge in Covid-19 cases\u00a0and are likely to be brimming with voters who cast a ballot\u00a0for President Donald Trump and have taken note of his dismissiveness of masks. In many of these places, Walmart is one of consumers\u2019 only options for buying household essentials. If a grocery trip can normalize mask-wearing\u00a0for these people, that\u2019s a win for everyone\u2019s health. Walmart also has plenty of establishments in states such as Florida and Texas where cases are surging and governors have been reticent to take aggressive action to stop it. In those places, the chain is effectively stepping in to curb the spread of Covid-19 where lawmakers have failed.\u00a0As the country\u2019s largest retailer, Walmart\u2019s move also gives cover to smaller chains to require mask-wearing. I\u2019m sure many mom-and-pop retailers have seen the viral videos of\u00a0shoppers throwing tantrums\u00a0at store employees over mask policies and are loathe to have such fire-breathing scenes happen in their establishments. But if mighty Walmart is making customers do this, these stores should feel\u00a0emboldened to make the choice that is best for public health. In fact, within hours of Walmart\u2019s announcement, industry trade group the National Retail Federation issued a press release urging all retailers to require customers to wear masks nationwide. The group said it hoped Walmart\u2019s move was \u201ca tipping point\u201d on this issue.\u00a0It remains to be seen how easily and successfully Walmart can enforce this policy. The company says it will install \u201chealth ambassadors\u201d at each store, workers positioned near the entrance who will responsible for reminding visitors of the mask requirement. That may be a delicate task, especially at first. But, with any luck, Walmart\u2019s move will create an industrywide norm that will soon make the act of wearing a mask mundane and apolitical.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.
