Shares fell as Biogen Inc.\u2019s experimental Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug and Bristol Myers Squibb Co.\u2019s medicines acquired from Celgene Corp. were seen among those at risk.\u201cI\u2019m getting the question a lot about how the FDA had been so flexible for recent history and are they coming to a turning point where they\u2019re rejecting applications more freely,\u201d Baird analyst Brian Skorney said by phone. Without seeing the agency\u2019s communication with companies, \u201cit\u2019s hard to tell\u201d how much readthrough there might be to other drugs under review, he said.Biogen fell 2.8% on Wednesday, also weighed down by news of new generic competition for its multiple sclerosis drug. That puts even more pressure on aducanumab, an experimental therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s that has an FDA decision deadline of March 7.Bristol Myers\u2019s lisocabtagene maraleucel has a target decision date of Nov. 16 in large B-cell lymphoma and its application with partner Bluebird Bio Inc. for idecabtagene vicleucel in multiple myeloma was re-filed with U.S. regulators last month. Approval of liso-cel by Dec. 31 and ide-cel by March 31 would mean a $9 payout for holders of the contingent value right that was issued in the Celgene deal. Shares of the CVR fell as much as 2% on Wednesday to $2.88.Jared Holz, a health-care strategist at Jefferies, said he doesn\u2019t think the Gilead and BioMarin setbacks suggest \u201csome sort of sea change or trend with respect to how the FDA handles these drug approvals.\u201d The agency is seeking more data on both drugs, which analysts expect will delay approval by about a year for Gilead and Galapagos and closer to two years for BioMarin.In BioMarin\u2019s case, Holz said the availability of other drugs to treat hemophilia may give the FDA more leeway to take things slowly. The agency may also be signaling a higher bar for approvals in the new class of medicines known as gene therapies, he said.For Biogen, the lack of approved treatments in Alzheimer\u2019s could prove to be a key differentiator when it comes time for the FDA decision. Bristol-Myers\u2019s liso-cel and ide-cel would compete with old and new medicines.Other recent signals that the FDA may be growing more cautious include a New York Times report that the agency has placed the authorization for blood plasma as a Covid-19 treatment on hold as it awaits more data.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-surprising-fda-rejections-raise-160059311.html"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-08-19 10:30:00", "title": "My Top Pharma Stock to Buy in the Next Market Crash", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Unexpected market corrections are regular events marked by at least a 10% decline in stock prices.

This is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that forms in the lining of the lungs, and is frequently caused by asbestos exposure.With a minimum follow-up of 22 months, treatment with Opdivo plus Yervoy reduced the risk of death by 26%, demonstrating a median OS of 18.1 months vs. 14.1 months for chemotherapy. At two years, 41% of patients treated with the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination were alive, compared to 27% of patients treated with chemotherapy.The safety profile of Opdivo plus Yervoy in the Phase 3 CheckMate -743 clinical trial was consistent with previously reported studies, and no new safety signals were observed.The primary endpoint of the randomized Phase 3 trial, which involved 605 patients, was OS in all randomized patients. Key secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).\u201cAn aggressive cancer with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%, malignant pleural mesothelioma has shown resistance to many clinical treatments,\u201d said\u00a0Paul Baas, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Thoracic Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute.\u201cNow, for the first time, we have evidence that a dual immunotherapy combination showed a superior, sustained overall survival benefit compared to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of all types of malignant pleural mesothelioma\u201d he stated, adding that the data supports the potential for nivolumab plus ipilimumab to become a new standard of care.Indeed, in CheckMate -743, Opdivo plus Yervoy showed improvements in survival across both non-epithelioid and epithelioid MPM, with a larger magnitude of benefit observed in the non-epithelioid subgroup. This is striking because non-epithelioid patients generally experience poorer outcomes.With the dual immunotherapy combination, median OS was 18.7 months for epithelioid patients and 18.1 months for non-epithelioid patients, compared to 16.5 months and 8.8 months, respectively, with chemotherapy.Opdivo plus Yervoy is a combination of two immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeting two different checkpoints to help destroy tumor cells: Yervoy helps activate and proliferate T cells, while Opdivo helps existing T cells discover the tumor.Shares in BMY are down 5% year-to-date, but the stock scores a bullish Strong Buy consensus from the Street. That\u2019s with an average analyst\u00a0price target\u00a0of $69 (13% upside potential).On August 6 JP Morgan\u2019s\u00a0Chris Schott\u00a0reiterated his buy rating on the stock, writing 2Q sales were negatively impacted due to unwinding of COVID-19-related stocking in 1Q, reduced new patient starts, and fewer patient visits to physicians.However the analyst noted that management expects an accelerated resumption of clinical trials in 2H20. \u201cWe found the commentary to be comparable to other large-cap biopharma companies this earnings season\u201d Schott wrote. He has a $74 price target on BMY for upside potential of 21%.(See BMY stock analysis on TipRanks).Related News:  Amarin\u2019s Vascepa To Take Part In Covid-19 Study In Adults With Heart Disease  Moderna Secures $400M In Deposits For Supply Of Covid-19 Vaccine Candidate  Eli Lilly, Innovent Deliver Encouraging Lung Cancer Data For Sintilimab More recent articles from Smarter Analyst:  * AstraZeneca Strikes First China Manufacturing Deal For Covid-19 Candidate   * Regeneron Prices $1.25B Public Offering; Analyst Cautious On Valuation   * Cisco Completes ThousandEyes Deal; Analyst Warns Of Growth Headwinds   * Roper Looking To Snap Up Vertafore For $5.5 Billion- Report", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bristol-myers-reports-significant-survival-075401892.html"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-08-10 00:00:00", "title": "Analysis on Impact of COVID-19- Global Hepatocellular Carcinoma Drugs Market 2020-2024 | Evolving Opportunities with AbbVie Inc. and Amgen Inc. | Technavio", "image": "https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200810005402/en/811625/23/IRTNTR44339.jpg", "site": "businesswire", "text": "The Global Hepatocellular Carcinoma Drugs Market will grow by $ 85.10 mn during 2020-2024", "url": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200810005402/en/Analysis-Impact-COVID-19--Global-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma-Drugs"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-08-09 00:00:00", "title": "The Week Ahead In Biotech: Bausch Health, Fennec Pharma FDA Decisions And Smid-cap Earnings", "image": "https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/medic-563423_1920_398_27.jpg", "site": "benzinga", "text": "Biotech stocks advanced in the week ended Aug. 7, buoyed by multiple catalysts.

After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $61.05.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $60.00  * Volume: 2743  * Open Interest: 230483 Signs of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume is one indication of unusual options activity. Volume refers to the total shares contracts traded in a day when discussing options activity. Open interest describes unsettled contracts that have been traded but not closed by a counter-party. In other words, for each contract buyer, there must be a seller. A purchased contract remains open until a seller closes it, and vice versa.Another gauge of unusual options activity is a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are \"out of the money\" are also indicative of unusual options activity. \"Out of the money\" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Understanding Sentiment Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * A Look Into Bristol-Myers Squibb's Debt  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NYSE: BMY) fell by 3.38%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let's look at how much debt Bristol-Myers Squibb has.Bristol-Myers Squibb's Debt Based on Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial statement as of May 7, 2020, long-term debt is at $42.84 billion and current debt is at $3.86 billion, amounting to $46.71 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $15.82 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $30.89 billion.Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Bristol-Myers Squibb has $129.28 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.36. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than 1 indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. For example, a debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry, whereas normal for another.Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital.Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.See more from Benzinga  * Benzinga's Top Upgrades, Downgrades For July 28, 2020(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty.Insiders continued to add shares despite overall market volatility and economic uncertainty. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases reported in the past week.Continental Resources Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE: CLR) saw its founder and executive chair, Harold Hamm, return and purchase more than 1.52 additional shares last week. At per-share prices between $16.23 and $18.10, that totaled nearly $26.74 million. His stake is up to more than 12.29 million shares. The total float is about 69.8 million shares.Hamm has been buying shares for almost a month, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Continental Resources stock pulled back more than 12% last week and was last seen at $16.03 a share. That is below Hamm's most recent purchase price range. The share price still is up nearly 8% since the year-to-date low back in early March.Acceleron Acceleron Pharma Inc (NASDAQ: XLRN) saw 10% owner and partner Celgene recently take advantage of a secondary offering to acquire more than 108,000 shares for $92.50 apiece. That totaled just shy of $10 million. Note that Celgene is a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  (NYSE: BMY).Cambridge Massachusetts-based Acceleron recently posted positive heart drug study results. Its stock closed down marginally last week at $99.99 a share, above Celgene's purchase price. The share price is more than 88% higher since the beginning of the year but has a consensus target price of $123.80.See Also: Insider Sells Marvell Technology Group's SharesSyneos Health A director purchased almost 8,700 Syneos Health Inc (NASDAQ: SYNH) shares early last week. The share price was $59.11, and the total for the transaction came to more than $513,700. This also was pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan, and that director's stake almost doubled.Its second-quarter earnings report is due August 6. Syneos Health shares ended last week about 2% lower to $56.38. That is below the above purchase price. While the share price is about 33% higher since its year-to-date low in March, it is still well below its consensus price target of $64.67.Furthermore, note that some amount of insider buying at Bloomin' Brands Inc (NASDAQ: BLMN), Cooper Companies Inc (NYSE: COO) and Herman Miller, Inc. (NASDAQ: MLHR) was reported last week as well.See more from Benzinga  * Notable Insider Buys: Novartis, T-Mobile And More  * Notable Insider Buys: Continental Resources, Fox, Groupon And More(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Now she\u2019s turning her focus to longer-term growth and advancing non-cancer therapies in a bid to win back investors\u2019 trust.\u201cIf somebody was going to measure my performance, at least only on the basis of the stock price, I have not done a very good job for the last year and a half,\u201d Fouse joked in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work very hard to show that our drug is differentiated from the competition,\u201d she said in reference to mitapivat, an experimental therapy for disorders like sickle cell anemia that analysts say could one day top $1 billion in sales.One of investors\u2019 biggest complaints has been how quickly Agios burns through cash. The company has spent more than $1 billion on research and development since 2017 compared to revenue of about $255 million over that stretch, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\u201cI don\u2019t think the criticism around the cash burn has completely gone away,\u201d Fouse said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been chipping away at that.\u201dAgios has two products on the market -- one wholly owned and one partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb Co.\u2019s Celgene -- though Wall Street has been focused on mitapivat. The experimental medicine \u201cmay end up being a multi-billion dollar drug,\u201d according to Fouse. However, efforts in sickle cell face competition from Global Blood Therapeutics Inc.\u2019s Oxbryta and experimental therapies from Bluebird Bio Inc. and partners Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Crispr Therapeutics AG.\u201cWhile Agios aims to initiate pivotal trials in thalassemia and sickle cell anemia in 2021, mitapivat\u2019s safety profile in SCA could become a critical factor in a future competition with Oxbryta, which has demonstrated compelling safety data,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Mark Breidenbach wrote in a June 14 note.For Wall Street analysts, Agios\u2019s ability to nab Fouse was a steal. Amid speculation she would take the top job at Gilead Sciences Inc. -- since filled by Daniel O\u2019Day -- Fouse said the allure of a smaller company was attractive. She wouldn\u2019t say whether Gilead had approached her to become CEO, instead saying she was \u201capproached about a lot of jobs\u201d after she left Celgene in 2017.Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Agios are down 1% since Fouse took over in February of last year. That compares to a 27% rally for the closely watched Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and places it 127th among the index\u2019s 206 companies.The next catalyst for Agios shares is likely to come later this year with additional results from the early-stage trial of mitapivat in sickle cell. Data for a pair of studies in pyruvate kinase deficiency are also due between year-end and the middle of 2021.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agios-pharma-ceo-jackie-fouse-111638094.html"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-07-10 06:18:42", "title": "Natco Pharma\u2019s Canadian unit signs pact with Celgene for cancer treatment drug | Business", "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_19_19_03_7965895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "site": "https://www.devdiscourse.com", "text": "Natco Pharma on Friday said its Canadian subsidiary has entered into a settlement agreement with biopharmaceutical firm Celgene (part of Bristol-Myers Squibb) for Lenalidomide capsules.", "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/1124645-natco-pharmas-canadian-unit-signs-pact-with-celgene-for-cancer-treatment-drug"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-07-09 17:18:09", "title": "Cross-Sector: Market Data Highlights", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cross-sector-market-data-highlights-171809831.html"}, {"symbol": "BMY", "publishedDate": "2020-07-09 16:00:04", "title": "Bristol Myers (BMY) Moves to Strong Buy: Rationale Behind the Upgrade", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Bristol Myers (BMY) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank 1 (Strong Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects.
