In a note published Tuesday, BofA increased its price objectives on banks by 11%, outlining a 21% implied upside for larger companies and a 20% upside for small and mid-cap banks. It pointed out that the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has gained more than 50% since early November when Pfizer announced the creation of a coronavirus vaccine and is up about 20% so far in 2021. \"[But] we think the sector has room to run,\" said BofA.\u00a0 Among the calls, the target on JPMorgan Chase shares was pushed up to $181 from $163, with a potential gain of 20% from Monday's close at just below $151. The \"economic recovery is fast gaining steam, and will be likely turbocharged by the recently passed $1.9 trillion stimulus plan,\" said BofA analysts led by Erika Najarian in a note about the higher price objectives. Also, BofA's rates strategists have upwardly revised their year-end forecast on the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.15% from 1.75%.\u00a0 The US government has been sending $1,400 checks to most Americans as part of the stimulus package. Bank of America foresees 2021 economic growth of 6.5% with an upward bias. Meanwhile, investors pricing in the potential for hotter inflation stoked by economic growth have propelled the 10-year yield to 14-month highs, past 1.7%. The 10-year yield and other long-dated Treasury yields are tied to mortgages, auto loans and other lending programs and banks can earn more from loans as those rates increase. Wells Fargo's price objective was lifted to $43 from $39, indicating a 10% increase from Monday's settlement \u00a0Citigroup's target was unchanged at $100 but still implies a 39% gain.\u00a0 BofA said banks during recent conversations ahead of their quiet period before earnings, \"suggest a continued upward bias to consensus estimates,\" even though there are expectations for \"softer net interest income trends\" in the first quarter. That view stems from stronger liquidity levels \"as solid deposit growth continues to outpace loan growth near-term.\" \"It's early in the bank renaissance,\" said BofA. \"Perhaps the most important takeaway to emerge from the economic shock of the pandemic is that it finally proved that banks had transformed themselves from the Global Financial Crisis, with all banks under coverage remaining profitable for full-year 2020, even with an accelerated increase in loan loss reserves,\" the analysts said. \"This should effectively lower the cost of equity the markets assign to banks in recovery.\"", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/bank-stocks-rise-on-economic-improvement-recovery-jpm-wfc-c-2021-3"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2021-03-22 16:42:17", "title": "Bank stocks tumble as yields falling from 14-month high pause interest-income optimism (KBE, WFC, C, BAC, JPM)", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/b/a/bank-stocks-tumble-as-yields-falling-from-14-month-high-pause-interest-income-optimism-734359.jpg", "site": "Business Insider", "text": "Bank stocks dropped Monday, with a widely watched bank ETF pulling further away from a 13-year high as borrowing costs tracked by the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.

On the day, the greenback is tumbling against most of its major peers, led by the pound and the euro. The shared currency climbed to a two-year high, extending its advance since last month\u2019s landmark European Union stimulus package brightened the region\u2019s prospects relative to the U.S.The greenback has been on the defensive since mid-year, with U.S. lawmakers unable to agree on measures to support the economy\u2019s recovery from the pandemic, and with U.S. real yields dropping to multi-year lows. On top of all that, investors\u2019 attention is turning to the November presidential election and the uncertainty that may bring.\u201cBroader positioning against the USD is not overly stretched,\u201d said Shaun Osborne, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank. Investors and speculators are \u201conly just starting to embrace the short USD story. There is room for this move to run.\u201dWagers on dollar losses by hedge funds and other large speculators have been building, but have yet to reach the levels seen in 2017 and 2018, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.The dollar failed to gain much traction Tuesday even after a report showed U.S. housing starts surged in July amid record-low interest rates. The resilience in that corner of the economy comes as roughly 15 million Americans remain out of work in the virus\u2019s wake.With some investors still skeptical about the durability of the recovery and the Federal Reserve buying billions of dollars of Treasuries to support markets, benchmark U.S. yields remain not far above record lows.The 10-year U.S. real yield, which is the rate after stripping out inflation, is now only about 30 basis points above its German counterpart. That\u2019s the smallest spread since 2014.\u201cMomentum is on the bears\u2019 side now, and until the U.S. can get the virus under better control, I think the dollar remains under pressure,\u201d said Win Thin, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-slide-gains-momentum-pillars-161540632.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 15:26:00", "title": "Here\u2019s the Real Reason Tesla Stock Is Soaring", "image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-222117/social", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "The long rally in Tesla shares has generated a lot of debate on Wall Street\u2014not so much about why the stock is up, but why so much.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/tesla-stock-financial-technology-robinhood-zero-commissions-earnings-upgrades-51597764131"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 14:55:00", "title": "Renewed Focus on Race Triggers Surge of Interest in Community-Based Lenders", "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-221697/social", "site": "wsj", "text": "A network of financial institutions set up to address economic inequality have received multimillion-dollar investments from Goldman Sachs Group, Bank of America, Netflix and Google, among others, following the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened attention on race.", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/renewed-focus-on-race-triggers-surge-of-interest-in-community-based-lenders-11597743000"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:53:00", "title": "Warren Buffett undergoes a conversion on gold \u2014 should you follow him?", "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IM647_gold_b_ZG_20200817135340.jpg", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "U.S. government policies have been good for the precious metal, though there are unique risks for investors.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-undergoes-a-conversion-on-gold-should-you-follow-him-2020-08-17"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:07:44", "title": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Trading Lower After Buffett Sale", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) stock has failed to mount support broken in the first quarter and could eventually drop into the $70s.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/651dab29-b8d1-3207-8518-5d128ae2b6d9/jpmorgan-chase-%28jpm%29-trading.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 12:20:10", "title": "U.S. and European firms face $1 trillion in costs to relocate their Chinese supply chains, BofA says", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105521856-1540233484377gettyimages-1052492492.jpeg?v=1547209305", "site": "cnbc", "text": "Foreign firms looking to move their manufacturing processes outside of China in the wake of coronavirus could face $1 trillion in costs over five years, according to new Bank of America research.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/bofa-us-european-firms-face-1-trillion-to-relocate-china-supply-chains.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 10:50:12", "title": "Bank Of America Vs.

They\u00a0rely on their Wall Street contacts and industry experience to size up the new-issue corporate-debt\u00a0market and quickly determine whether they should bid on new securities and at what price. Making that calculation often requires both knowledge of broad global market sentiment and micro-level credit analysis, all in the span of hours.To adrenaline-craving\u00a0traders, that probably sounds exhilarating. But it\u2019s just as\u00a0likely exhausting, particularly given 2020\u2019s breakneck pace of new deals: U.S. investment-grade bond sales reached a yearly\u00a0record this week, exceeding the previous all-time high of $1.3 trillion for all of 2017. Even though spreads on high-grade corporate debt have relentlessly narrowed this year, providing steep gains across credit funds, investors still prefer to have reasoning for their\u00a0decisions and comprehensive information at their disposal instead of just\u00a0chasing a rally indiscriminately.At least\u00a0that seems to be the message behind a letter published Monday by the Credit Roundtable,\u00a0an industry group\u00a0that comprises\u00a0big-name asset managers like\u00a0AllianceBernstein Holding LP,\u00a0Franklin Resources Inc.,\u00a0PGIM Fixed Income, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., along with insurance companies and California\u2019s two main public pension funds. As Bloomberg News\u2019s Molly Smith reported, it\u2019s a push to make Wall Street and regulators adopt industry standards that are seen as long overdue\u00a0when\u00a0the\u00a0biggest banks are gearing up to introduce an\u00a0electronic platform for new offerings.There\u2019s no question that the new-issue corporate-bond market appears archaic in comparison to Robinhood and other instant-trading apps. The entire process ends up taking\u00a0about a day for investment-grade bonds: First\u00a0an early-session\u00a0announcement (Bloomberg terminal headlines declare NEW DEAL); then sometimes\u00a0updated pricing relative to initial levels based on investor demand (GUIDANCE); then the actual launch that reveals or updates the size of the offering (LAUNCH); and ultimately final terms (PRICED). In the meantime, behind the scenes, traders might pass along what they\u00a0hear\u00a0about the size of investor bids\u00a0and speculate just how much the\u00a0\u201coversubscribed\u201d order book will cut into yields. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg Opinion, provides services\u00a0that facilitate bond ordering and distributes information on new debt offerings.)This year has featured severe repricing in favor of borrowers. According to Smith, yields on investment-grade bonds in 2020 have compressed more than\u00a031 basis points on average between initial talk and final pricing, compared with less than 19 basis points in 2019 and\u00a015\u00a0basis points in 2018. As it stands, companies have an advantage over investors because even though they might know the ideal size for their bond deal, they don\u2019t need to disclose that figure right away. In one dramatic example during the height of the coronavirus crisis, cruise line operator Carnival Corp. dangled a huge\u00a013% yield on its investment-grade bonds, drummed up roughly\u00a0$17 billion in orders, then boosted the offering to $4 billion while trimming the coupon to 11.5%.The Credit Roundtable\u2019s recommendations largely boil down to standardizing information and communication across new deals. The group suggests either a borrower provides \u201cexpected\u201d credit ratings when the deal is announced\u00a0or the rating companies confirm their grades\u00a0within 15 minutes. Investors also want an indication of the initial deal size during the \u201cannouncement\u201d phase, along with specific\u00a0maturity dates and disclosure of any nonstandard terms. Throughout the process, they\u2019re asking for frequent order-book updates to get a more transparent look at demand. Pricing should be wrapped up by 4:30 p.m. in New York\u00a0or else\u00a0risk pricing the next day.All of this sounds perfectly reasonable on its face. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to bring the underwriting and distribution of corporate bonds into the 21st century,\u201d said David Knutson, vice chair of the Credit Roundtable and head of credit research for the Americas at Schroder Investment Management.So then\u00a0why have these seemingly common-sense, pro-transparency adjustments remained elusive for so long?\u00a0Those who follow the battles within corporate-bond market structure\u00a0might recall that\u00a0BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., neither of whom are part of the Credit Roundtable,\u00a0were on the same side\u00a0recently in advocating for a pilot program that would reduce secondary-market transparency in exchange for potentially better liquidity. T. Rowe Price and Vanguard, by contrast, were among those that opposed the initiative. However, while shrouding large corporate-bond block trades in secrecy quite obviously benefits BlackRock and Pimco, it\u2019s not as clear how keeping the current primary-market process in place gives them a disproportionate advantage.It\u2019s possible Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks stood in favor of the old way of doing things, but that seems to be changing. Smith\u2019s reporting suggested the bond-buyer group wants to seize on momentum from the coming launch of\u00a0DirectBooks LLC, an electronic\u00a0platform for new debt offerings\u00a0backed by Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. Or,\u00a0put another way, it has the support of the seven largest U.S. investment-grade bond underwriters, and nine of the top 11, together responsible for bringing almost $1 trillion to market this year.Maybe I\u2019m being overly optimistic given the bond market\u2019s history of slow progress, but it\u2019s hard to come up with a serious case against this modernization push. That\u2019s especially true for\u00a0investment-grade debt \u2014\u00a0companies with high credit ratings\u00a0are frequent borrowers and far less likely to try\u00a0to sneak through unfavorable lender protections or otherwise catch investors by surprise, in contrast to high-yield bonds and leveraged loans.The only thing in jeopardy might be the image of\u00a0bond traders as ultra-connected Wall Street denizens who pore\u00a0over pricing updates from bank syndicates as they hit their screens. After all, it\u2019s hard to maintain the three-decade-old reputation as Masters of the Universe when on a level playing field for information, not to mention when\u00a0robots are doing an increasing share of the\u00a0work. Taking obvious steps to democratize the primary market for corporate bonds is worth a dent to\u00a0the mythos.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com As of Berkshire's Aug. 4 filing, the holding company now owns 11.9% of Bank of America, worth a cool $28.2 billion or 11.4% of its $246.6 billion equity portfolio. If you're Berkshire shareholder, take solace in the fact the company's Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stake is almost four times as large. I don't think you have to be Warren Buffett to know Apple's growth potential is much higher than Bank of America's. But I digress. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBuffett might own a big chunk of Bank of America, but that doesn't necessarily make it a buy. Here's why.  BAC Stock Hasn't Been Great in 2020There are seven financial stocks in Berkshire's top 10 holdings. Cumulatively, the seven stocks account for 30.5% of its overall portfolio.  Buffett's Top 10 Holdings - Performance YTD Company Market CapYear to Date Total ReturnApple $1.89T 54.4% Bank of America $236.5B -23.6% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) $206.4B -12.3% American Express (NYSE:AXP) $84.0B -17.3% Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) $42.6B 10.8% Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) $105.3B -52.0% Moody's (NYSE:MCO) $51.6B 14.7% JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) $318.7B -25.9% U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) $57.8B -35.4% Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) $33.9B -22.8% Source: Morningstar.com, data through Aug. 10The seven financial stocks have an average year-to-date total return of -23.2%, 40 basis points less than Bank of America's total return so far in 2020. The three non-financial stocks have an average total return of $17.6%, primarily on the back of a fantastic performance by the maker of iPhones.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short ListNow, if you take out Wells Fargo and Moody's (the worst and best returns of the financial services companies), the average falls to 19.1%, putting Bank of America squarely in the underperforming category along with JPMorgan, etc. Financial services companies of all types have generally done poorly in 2020. The iShares US Financial Services ETF (NYSEARCA:IYG) has a YTD total return of 16.1%. That's 300 basis points less than the average for the five Berkshire holdings, and 750 basis points less than BAC. So, if Buffett were to hedge his bet and buy iShares' ETF, Berkshire shareholders would be much farther ahead in 2020.  Why BAC Shares Are CheapTwo of the latest InvestorPlace articles about Bank of America both suggest Buffett is on to something. Mark Hake believes that once the bank's earnings return to normal in two or three years, its tangible book value per share (TBVPS) should be $22.13 a share. Its share price, based on a typical multiple of 1.75 times TBVPS, would be $38.73, for a compound annual growth rate of 15,4%, using a midpoint of 2.5 years.   Hake goes on to suggest that Bank of America typically has a dividend yield of 1.76%. At the moment it is 2.64%. My colleague points out that based on a historical dividend yield of 1.76%, BAC should be trading at $40.91, providing 52% potential upside.InvestorPlace's David Moadel recently discussed the fact Buffett picked up some more BAC stock as an argument why it's too cheap to ignore.  \"Historically, BAC stock has been a good one to buy and hold after it crashes. If you've been trading for a while, you might recall the mind-numbing collapse in the BAC share price from $50 in early 2007 to less than $7 in 2008,\" Moadel wrote on Aug. 4. \"All these years later, BAC stock hasn't gotten back to $50, but it was chugging along smoothly at $35 early this year. Then came the coronavirus, and BAC shares tumbled down to the $18 area in March.\"Now trading around $27, it's trading at just 16.9 times its forward price-earnings ratio, and 12.8 times its trailing 12-month P/E ratio, the lowest point in the past five years.  The Economy Is Still FragileThe last time I wrote about Bank of America was in mid-June. At the time, I wasn't interested in where its share price was headed, but rather in expressing support for the bank's Merrill Lynch financial advisors. They were under pressure from management to produce new business in an operating environment that made it very difficult to attract customers. I've spent a decent amount of time writing about the financial advisor community in my not-to-distant past. While there were some really bad apples among the people I interviewed, there were also some professionals who cared about their customers and helped them reach their financial goals. Most of my colleagues believe that once the economy gets back to normal, the big banks will all return to making lots of money. I tend to agree. That's especially the case with BAC, who wisely lowered the number of financial advisors getting pay cuts in June as a result of not hitting specific financial targets. Ask a restaurant owner or a retail store manager how easy it is to grow sales over last year in the middle of a pandemic. Impossible would be the answer. Merrill Lynch is an essential part of the bank's growth. To irritate the brokers in this environment would set the bank back immensely, in my opinion. Wisely, it changed its mind. Bottom Line on BAC StockDown the road, Buffett will probably look like a genius loading up on Bank of America stock. I'm not nearly as confident about its long-term prognosis. The banks have generally underachieved since 2008. Under $20, BAC is a bargain. Around $27, I think it's fairly valued. If you're buying for three to five years, I don't see a problem buying its stock. Just don't expect to get rich quickly. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

For my money, Wells Fargo stock is the worst of a weak bunch.Source: Martina Badini / Shutterstock.com Wells Fargo has been the black sheep of bank stocks for a few years now, and nothing that it's accomplished lately is making people forget that.After all, it wasn't that long ago that Wells Fargo got in serious trouble for an accounting scandal that cost it billions of dollars. You surely remember when Wells Fargo employees, pressured to hit aggressive sales goals, created millions of fake savings and checking accounts in customers' names, without their consent.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe scandal came to light in 2016 and Wells Fargo stock really never recovered. It shattered the trust of its customers, regulators and members of Congress, who seem to revel in bringing WFC executives to Capitol Hill every now and then to be berated in front of TV cameras.Fast-forward to today and you'll see that things aren't that much better for WFC stock. Wells Fargo Stock at a GlanceIt's no surprise that bank stocks are having a tough 2020. The novel coronavirus forced millions of people out of work, which means millions of people don't know if they'll be able to make their mortgage, car or credit card payments in the long term.  * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List That cuts right to the bottom line of bank stocks like Wells Fargo, but some banks are handling the crisis better than others. And you can put Wells Fargo near the bottom of the list.Look at the major bank stocks right now and their year-to-date performances:  * Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is down 25%.  * JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is down 26.2%.  * Citigroup (NYSE:C) is down 33.5%.  * Wells Fargo is down 53%.The numbers don't lie. Wells Fargo is doing far worse in today's economic climate than its major competitors. A New ScandalIt's not as if Wells Fargo is doing a good job in recovering. In fact, the bank is pretty much shooting itself in the proverbial foot when it really needs to be regaining public trust.The latest trouble spot comes in the current economic crisis. Wells Fargo customers in at least 14 states are now on the record complaining that the bank put their accounts into forbearance plans without their consent or knowledge.Can you imagine how infuriating that would be? You're making your mortgage payments like clockwork for months, just to find out that your money isn't being credited toward your account.An unwanted forbearance means that customers can't even refinance their mortgages or get favorable interest rates. Wells Fargo calls the problem errors made \"in the spirit of providing assistance.\" Under New ManagementOne thing that Wells Fargo bulls point out is that the company is under new management to help it turn things around. And true, Charlie Scharf did a nice job as CEO of Visa (NYSE:V).But he took over Wells Fargo in 2019, so he has been around long enough to own the company's earnings reports. And at least in the last quarter, the numbers weren't kind.Second-quarter earnings came in at $17.84 billion, which was lower than Wall Street's expectations of $18.4 billion. Adjusted losses per share were 66 cents, while analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents per share.For the quarter, the company posted a net loss of $2.4 billion, compared to net income of $6.21 billion in the same quarter a year ago.Wells Fargo was forced to slash its dividend, from 51 cents per share to a meager 10 cents per share.Scharf used uncommonly frank language to talk about the company's performance:\"While the negative impact of the pandemic is unprecedented and many of our business drivers were negatively impacted, our franchise should perform better, and we will make changes to improve our performance regardless of the operating environment.\"He's right. Wells Fargo should perform better. Investors should demand it. The Bottom Line on WFC StockAs an investor, I love grabbing shares of wounded companies if I truly believe in the business model and the long-term prospects of the company. That's one reason why I scooped up Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) instead of an airline like American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).But I can't make the same move on WFC stock. There are too many headwinds for bank stocks in general, particularly as fintech companies give customers more tools to manage their own money.And don't forget Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) flirtation with the banking business. I don't expect Jeff Bezos to slow down on the idea of managing people's money before he has a chance to snap it up with the convenience of two-day delivery.Avoid buying the dip on Wells Fargo stock.

Still, there are more Americans seeking benefits each week than at the highest point following the 2008 financial crisis.Other high-frequency indicators, such as credit-card spending and airline passengers, suggest the economic rebound remains gradual, and a measure of consumer sentiment just touched a five-week low.\u201cThe direction is encouraging,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp., who highlighted that the labor market may be catching up to other more positive indicators. \u201cBut the level is still high, which means there\u2019s more work to be done. We\u2019re five months after the initial shock in March, and claims at 963,000 are still very much in recessionary territory.\u201dRead more: Bloomberg\u2019s TOPLive blog on the jobless claims dataContinuing claims -- the total number of Americans claiming ongoing benefits in state programs -- also decreased to 15.5 million in the week ended Aug. 1, the lowest since early April. But they\u2019re still far above historical levels going back to the 1960s.Economists were expecting higher figures on Thursday, with a median estimate of 1.1 million for initial claims and continuing claims of 15.8 million.The bigger-than-expected drop in claims follows an ebbing in new coronavirus cases, underlining how important control of the virus is for an economy that remains well below its pre-crisis state. It may support the argument by some businesses and Republicans that the $600 benefit -- which expired in July -- was keeping people from returning to work.The improvement in the data could reduce the pressure on the White House and lawmakers to quickly agree on a new stimulus package.Challenges PersistWith unemployment above 10% in July, the labor market still faces challenges, including a high level of virus cases and widespread business closures and bankruptcies, as well as online learning that\u2019s forcing Americans to take care of their children at home.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a much harder slog ahead,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, head of monetary policy research at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cStates have paused or rolled back some of their reopening, the secondary effects of the recession are beginning to kick in,\u201d and more business bankruptcies will weigh on employment, he said.\u201cOne concern for both the job market and the broader economy is the lack of urgency in passing another round of fiscal stimulus. The economy needs more fiscal stimulus.\u201dWhat Bloomberg\u2019s Economists Say\u201cThe favorable direction of travel still leaves the job market well short of a healthy destination. Flows out of employment are consistent with the deepest post-war recessions. The effects of shadow joblessness -- labor force exits -- and long-term unemployment will persist for an extended period.\u201d\\-- Andrew HusbyRead more for the full reaction note.U.S. stocks were mixed Thursday, a day after the S&P 500 benchmark closed within 0.2% of its all-time high. Treasuries were little changed, while the dollar was lower.The latest declines in initial claims spanned states where coronavirus cases had bloomed in prior weeks, such as California and Florida, as well as New York, where counts have remained low. President Donald Trump last weekend authorized the payment of an extra $400 a week in jobless benefits to unemployed Americans, smaller than the $600 benefit that expired in July -- and limited by funds that could run out within two months.Rather than a straightforward $400 top-up, though, the payment is actually just $300 in additional federal funds, and states can choose whether or not to add the $100 from their own coffers. Trump also announced a four-month deferral of payroll taxes, though economists questioned the effectiveness of such a move.In addition to applications for benefits in regular state programs, states reported 488,622 initial claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA, in the week ended Aug. 8. That\u2019s the federal program offering jobless benefits to those who don\u2019t qualify for the state program, such as the self-employed and gig workers.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-jobless-claims-below-1-125731889.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-13 15:13:02", "title": "Buffett Buyers Lift Bank Of America Shares To 2-Month High", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Warren Buffett has just placed a risky $520 million bet on the U.S. commercial banking sector.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-buyers-lift-bank-america-151302492.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-13 14:25:25", "title": "How Bank of America Makes Money: consumer banking", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Bank of America generates the largest part of its revenue from consumer banking, however the largest share of net income comes from Global Markets.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a6990193-2cd5-3599-863e-ebd6617742bb/how-bank-of-america-makes.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-12 20:25:00", "title": "Bank of America Corp. stock falls Wednesday, underperforms market", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "COMPANY CLOSE UPDATES  Terrence Horan Shares of Bank of America Corp.

A measure of gold volatility over the past month jumped to the highest since April. U.S. equities traded higher on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 edging toward a record, helping limit gains for bullion.Gold is still one of the best-performing commodities of 2020 after the coronavirus outbreak pummeled the global economy, prompting central banks and governments to deploy massive stimulus. While a host of catalysts including geopolitical tensions and the threat of Covid-19 outbreaks are expected to continue to underpin demand for bullion as a haven, the metal may take time to regain momentum with investors spooked by the rout, according to Commerzbank AG.\u201cThe impressive summer rally enjoyed by gold and silver came to an explosive end yesterday,\u201d Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note. \u201cWe are unlikely to see prices return quickly to the highs they achieved at the end of last week.

That came a day after the white metal tumbled 15%, while silver futures on the Comex fell 11% in record volume.Benchmark Treasury yields have climbed more than 10 basis points so far this month amid improving risk appetite and an imminent flood of debt issuance. The recent rebound reflects investor hopes that the coronavirus will be contained, according to Standard Chartered Plc.Still, U.S. consumer prices excluding volatile food and fuel costs rose the most in about three decades in July, topping estimates, a report Wednesday showed.

(AP) - Warren Buffett's company reported an 87% jump in its second-quarter profit as the paper value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market, but it took a roughly $10 billion write down on the value of its aircraft parts manufacturing business because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. \n Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said Saturday that it earned $26.3 billion, or $16,314 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That's up from $14.1 billion, or $8,608 per share, a year ago. \n Berkshire said it cut the value of its Precision Castparts unit because of how much the pandemic has hurt air travel and businesses that support that airline industry. Precision Castparts cut about 10,000 jobs, or about 30% of its workforce, during the first half of the year as it responded to the reduced demand. \n CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert said the Precision Castparts write-down - combined with Berkshire's sale of all its airline stocks earlier this year - suggests that Buffett expects the pandemic to have a lasting negative impact on the airline business. \n Buffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. They also exclude the Precision Castparts write down. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings declined 10% to $5.5 billion, or $3,420.48 per Class A share, as most of its businesses were hurt by restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic. That's down from $6.1 billion, or $3,754.83 per share. \n The four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected operating earnings per Class A share of $3,182.06. \n The pandemic's impact on Berkshire's businesses was significant, but Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said it may not have been as bad as expected, partly because Geico...", "url": "https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Profit-up-87-at-Buffett-s-firm-but-virus-slows-15468955.php"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 18:55:49", "title": "Buffett&#39;s Berkshire Reports Earnings This Weekend: Here&#39;s What to Expect", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Investors should keep an eye on share buybacks and operating earnings Continue reading...", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-reports-earnings-weekend-222618662.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 18:29:16", "title": "Bitcoin es casi tan grande como Bank of America - ESP BlockBoard", "image": "https://blockboard.net/es/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/08/bitcoin-es-casi-tan-grande-como-bank-of-america.jpg", "site": "https://blockboard.net", "text": "A medida que los precios de las criptomonedas contin\u00faan subiendo, la capitalizaci\u00f3n de mercado de Bitcoin casi ha alcanzado a la de Bank of America.

En ese momento, la capitalizaci\u00f3n de mercado de Bitcoin se mantuvo cerca de los USD 145 mil millones.La tendencia alcista del precio de Bitcoin permanece intacta incluso despu\u00e9s de que BTC volviera al soporte de los 11,400 d\u00f3laresEn abril, el CEO de Amazon, Jeff Bezos, anunci\u00f3 un patrimonio neto de aproximadamente USD 140 mil\u00a0millones, con una capitalizaci\u00f3n de mercado de Bitcoin cercana a los USD 130 mil millones. En papel, parec\u00eda que Bezos podr\u00eda haber comprado todo el Bitcoin en circulaci\u00f3n con unos pocos miles de millones de d\u00f3lares de sobra, aunque la compra masiva probablemente resultar\u00eda imposible en la vida real, debido a factores como el aumento de los precios y la liquidez.Desde entonces, el patrimonio neto de Bezos ha alcanzado la exorbitante cifra de USD 193 mil millones.

Yet after a leaked recording of a conference call thrust Gallo\u2019s blunt communications style into the public, and turbulence emerged in parts of his business, the bank\u2019s bosses left him behind.While eight colleagues got invited to join the firm\u2019s elite management team in late July, Gallo was told to split duties with a former subordinate.The snub has drawn attention across Wall Street, turning a spotlight on an executive known for pushing subordinates especially hard. It has since prompted discussions between him and senior executives about how long he will remain at the investment bank, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be named discussing personnel. Another solution could still be found.Gallo, 54, referred messages to a company spokesperson who declined to comment.The trading veteran was passed over as Bank of America unveiled a series of promotions and added executives to its most senior decision-making body. New members of the panel include his longtime counterpart overseeing fixed-income markets, Jim Demare, who rose to head the global sales and trading division. One of Gallo\u2019s subordinates, Soofian Zuberi, was promoted to jointly run the stock-trading business alongside him.\u2018Great Job\u2019It marked a rapid change in fortunes for the industry veteran whose operations were credited with rising to unprecedented challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic in March, when traders were forced to work from home just as markets went into a nose dive.By the end of the first quarter, the equities-trading division\u2019s revenue jumped 39% to a record. In May, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan praised Gallo for the \u201cgreat job\u201d he was doing alongside fixed-income chiefs Demare and Bernie Mensah, who also was elevated to join the management team. In the second quarter, equities revenue rose 7%, fueled by cash and client financing.Yet there were also bumps. In April, someone leaked a recording of a controversial conference call to media outlets including CNBC and the New York Times. On it, Gallo could be heard saying \u201ccritical\u201d workers wouldn\u2019t be able to stay away from the office too long during the pandemic. The bank said at the time that the conversation was about returning people to the office once officials deemed it safe, and that the company was \u201csparing no expense or consideration taking care of our people.\u201dThen in a second-quarter regulatory filing, the bank flagged \u201cweaker trading performance\u201d in the unit\u2019s derivatives business. Though that business grew versus the previous year, it lost more than $100 million on some positions held in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The company\u2019s broader European business has seen a series of shakeups, most recently naming Martina Slowey to run equities for EMEA, replacing Julien Bahurel, who will leave after a transition period. That follows the June departure of Andrew Mitchell, head of equities trading in the region.Frustrating ManagersGallo, whose full first name is Fabrizio and goes by Fab, is known to frustrate his managers with a domineering style, getting deeply involved in trades and personnel decisions rungs below him, according to bank employees. That includes intervening in reviews for members of trading desks, sometimes overruling assessments drafted by the managers under him.A voracious reader, he cuts the image of a cultured intellect. He\u2019s also seen as arrogant. Colleagues say that in moments of frustration over the years, Gallo has lashed out at subordinates, calling them dumb. That and his blunt communication style have created detractors within the division, who accuse him of being unnecessarily abrasive.Some Bank of America employees also took umbrage at the leaked recording of Gallo. On it, he could be heard telling staff that if they wanted to keep critical roles, they would need to \u201cmake a decision\u201d about coming back to the office, CNBC reported in April.\u201cWe cannot provide proper and orderly markets if 99% of the population decides they don\u2019t feel comfortable,\u201d Gallo said on the recording. \u201cYou cannot on one hand say you cannot trust the firm and on the other hand get the money from the firm, for a long period of time if you are in a critical function. Now if people decide they don\u2019t want to be in a critical function we can have that conversation too.\u201dBank\u2019s ImageThe remarks came amid a debate inside many Wall Street firms over who could stay home and for how long. Yet those words didn\u2019t quite gel with Bank of America\u2019s efforts to remake its public image as a good corporate citizen after the 2008 financial crisis. Moynihan has been a prominent voice from the business community during the pandemic, pledging to support staff through tough times and resisting headcount reductions. He\u2019s also highlighted the lender\u2019s forbearance activities, its participation in the government\u2019s rescue-financing program for small businesses and a $1 billion pledge to communities of color over four years.Gallo joined the bank in 2011 from hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP and also spent more than a decade at Morgan Stanley, serving as head of equities and global proprietary trading.Despite his senior role, he keeps a relatively low profile. One of the few public references to Gallo is at the University of Chicago, where there\u2019s a dorm named after him. He contributes to financial aid and career programs there.His almost-decade-long run as sole head of equities was remarkable for its duration in an industry where co-chiefs are often the norm, forcing executives to compete and leaving firms with leadership options if businesses don\u2019t perform. Before the latest management shuffle, Gallo reported to the bank\u2019s chief operating officer Tom Montag, who\u2019s also president of its global banking and markets unit. If Gallo stays after the promotions, he will report to Demare.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-america-stocks-chief-considers-150308241.html"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 13:14:04", "title": "Profit up 87% at Buffett's firm but virus slows businesses", "image": "null", "site": "abcnews", "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s company reported an 87% jump in its second-quarter profit as the value of its investment portfolio increased with the stock market", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/profit-87-buffetts-firm-virus-slows-businesses-72254122"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 13:08:00", "title": "Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s profit jumps on market rebound", "image": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-ID586_arends_ZG_20200401175239.jpg", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said its second-quarter earnings surged 86%, as a rebound in the stock market offset a profit decline in the...", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/berkshire-hathaways-profit-jumps-on-market-rebound-2020-08-08"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 13:02:00", "title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Shows Strong Stock Gains, but It Takes a Big Hit on Precision Castparts", "image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-217753/social", "site": "barrons", "text": "Share buybacks totaled a record $5.1 billion for the quarter.", "url": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-shows-strong-investment-gains-for-second-quarter-51596891756"}, {"symbol": "BAC", "publishedDate": "2020-08-08 12:02:00", "title": "Which of Warren Buffett's Banks Have Done the Best During Coronavirus?
