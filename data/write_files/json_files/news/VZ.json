As organizations look to advance their hybrid workplace initiatives, the BlueJeans Gateway gives organizations the ability to extend their Microsoft Teams collaboration capabilities\u2014regardless of where employees are located. Additionally, Microsoft named Verizon as an early launch partner for their new Operator Connect platform. Operator Connect creates a direct peering relationship between the Microsoft Teams platform and Verizon's far-reaching SIP trunking network giving customers a more secure and enterprise-grade, end-to-end telephony solution and automation of provisioning and management processes. \u201cThe pandemic has intensified the need for organizations to have enterprise-grade collaboration solutions for their global workforces to stay connected and work more effectively from every possible environment,\u201d said Sampath Sowmyanarayan, President of Global Enterprise at Verizon Business. \u201cThese latest updates to our advanced communications portfolio with the BlueJeans Gateway and Microsoft's new Operator Connect platform, further simplify how enterprises can readily deploy solutions at-scale to streamline connectivity, extract the most value from existing investments, and future-proof collaboration infrastructure to meet the most pressing demands of the hybrid workplace.\u201d With Microsoft Teams reaching 115 million daily active users (DAU) in October 2020, IT and business leaders are now tasked with accelerating their approach for ensuring business continuity and Microsoft Teams connectivity for employees once office doors open back up. As a certified gold Microsoft partner, Verizon is uniquely positioned to support organizations of all sizes as they seek to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Teams. With these latest additions to the BlueJeans Gateway, Verizon is able to offer customers a more comprehensive communications solution for enhanced team connectivity, whether in the office or working remotely. With more than 1 billion cloud-connected room system minutes supporting thousands of different room system configurations, the Microsoft-certified BlueJeans Gateway for Microsoft Teams is a pure SaaS solution that enables customers to use their existing H.323 and SIP-based endpoints to join Microsoft Teams meetings from any conference room or huddle space. To date, close to 650 customers have chosen BlueJeans Gateway for Microsoft Teams as their cloud video interop (CVI) solution of choice for connecting their existing hardware infrastructure to join Microsoft Teams meetings. Layering onto BlueJeans' existing rich feature set, today's Gateway updates include greater CVI management controls to further simplify and enhance the room-based Microsoft Teams meeting experience.", "url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/02/2185614/0/en/Verizon-Business-Helps-Organizations-Embrace-Hybrid-Workplace-with-Purpose-Built-Solutions-for-Microsoft-Teams.html"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-03-01 18:57:14", "title": "Verizon Communications (VZ) Gains But Lags Market: What You Should Know", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/t/x/106328395-1578575605499rtx28sr4-702417.jpg", "site": "Zacks Investment Research", "text": "Verizon Communications (VZ) closed the most recent trading day at $55.36, moving +0.11% from the previous trading session.", "url": "https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1271457/verizon-communications-vz-gains-but-lags-market-what-you-should-know"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-03-01 11:51:16", "title": "HEQ: A 'Hedged' Portfolio, But Size And Poor Performance Limits Appeal", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/p/y/asset-management6-701308.jpg", "site": "Seeking Alpha", "text": "HEQ: A 'Hedged' Portfolio, But Size And Poor Performance Limits Appeal", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410309-heq-hedged-portfolio-size-and-poor-performance-limits-appeal"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-03-01 08:40:00", "title": "Why I Sold Verizon and Replaced It With IBM", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/i/k/urlhttps3a2f2fgfoolcdncom2feditorial2fimages2f6147602f5gjpgw700opresize-700710.jpg", "site": "The Motley Fool", "text": "If you like dividends but also want some business growth potential, IBM is well worth your attention.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/01/why-i-sold-verizon-and-replaced-it-with-ibm/"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-03-01 06:45:00", "title": "Warren Buffett Annual Letter Takeaway: Berkshire Is Cheap, Underappreciated", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/w/6/013e2df4cb5edeb98c42e51c44c1c32e-700350.png", "site": "The Motley Fool", "text": "Is Berkshire the Rodney Dangerfield of stocks?", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/01/warren-buffett-annual-letter-takeaway-berkshire-is/"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-03-01 06:33:00", "title": "3 Great Income Stocks to Buy Right Now", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/u/r/urlhttps3a2f2fgfoolcdncom2feditorial2fimages2f6072922fbuy-button-on-keyboardjpgw700opresize-uzr7kuvsmt-700328.jpg", "site": "The Motley Fool", "text": "These are serious dividend-paying machines.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/01/3-great-income-stocks-to-buy-right-now/"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-02-27 07:45:00", "title": "Buffett and His Proteges Take Opposite Sides in the 5G Wars", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/l/z/urlhttps3a2f2fgfoolcdncom2feditorial2fimages2f5517262fperson-using-smartphone-in-publicjpgw700opresize-699530.jpg", "site": "The Motley Fool", "text": "Berkshire bought into the 5G story in a big way last quarter, but spread its bets.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/27/buffett-and-his-proteges-take-opposite-sides-of-th/"}, {"symbol": "VZ", "publishedDate": "2021-02-26 11:55:53", "title": "3 Things to Look Out For in Warren Buffett's Annual Letter", "image": "https://cdn.snapi.dev/images/v1/v/o/oil32-698602.jpg", "site": "GuruFocus", "text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) is scheduled to report its annual results over the weekend.

The funding will help the We Mean Business coalition to provide one million small and medium sized businesses (SMEs) globally with tech-enabled carbon footprint quantification tools and the necessary education to enable a 50% reduction of their carbon emissions by 2030--with the goal to become net zero before 2050. This initiative underscores  Citizen Verizon , the company\u2019s responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement. \u201cSmall and medium businesses account for the majority of businesses worldwide, giving them a unique opportunity to enact significant impact on climate change,\u201d said Rose Stuckey Kirk, Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer at Verizon. \u201cThrough Citizen Verizon, we are committed to helping these businesses thrive, especially those with minority ownership, and providing the tools to have a long-lasting impact on their sustainability efforts.\u201d A portion of the funds will help to support climate curricula and online emissions assessment tools, online classes, and coaching for 10,000 SMEs ready to move to climate implementation. \u201cMobilizing SMEs to cut emissions is critical to addressing the climate crisis,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Mendiluce, CEO of We Mean Business. \u201cFor major corporations to deliver on their climate commitments they need to work with suppliers to reduce emissions at pace. We are delighted to be partnering with Verizon to provide tools and resources for SMEs to get started on their journey to net-zero through the  SME Climate Hub ; a new initiative launched this week, with support from Amazon, by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, Race to Zero and the We Mean Business coalition.\u201d Verizon\u2019s own sustainability goals are to source or generate renewable energy equivalent to 50% of its total annual electricity consumption by 2025 and be carbon neutral in its operations by 2035. Earlier this year, the company joined  The Climate Pledge  - a commitment co-founded by Amazon and Global Optimism to meet the Paris Agreement 10 years early. \u201cWe congratulate Verizon on the announcement of their support for the We Mean Business coalition,\u201d said Kara Hurst, VP, Sustainability, Amazon. \u201cThrough this very generous contribution, the We Mean Business coalition can continue to deepen its commitment to mobilize global supply chains, including small and medium enterprises, to take and scale-up measurable and direct action on climate change.\u201d Verizon is also supporting the transition to a greener grid by making substantial investments in renewable energy. The company recently  announced  the pricing of its second $1 billion Green Bond offering, with net proceeds being used primarily for long-term renewable energy purchase agreements, which support the construction of solar and wind facilities that will bring new renewable energy to the grids that power its networks.
