Work-from-home and contactless business operations have driven the demand for cloud-based services.According to a Fortune Business Insights study, the global e-signature market alone will reach $6.13 billion by 2026, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 28.77% in the 2019-2026 period.Using the TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison tool, we will compare these two cloud companies to see which stock offers the most compelling investment opportunity.Adobe (ADBE)Adobe\u2019s transformation into a SaaS or software-as-a-service company has facilitated its growth over the past few years. The company expanded beyond its creative software tools through other digital offerings like Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud. Adobe Document Cloud includes PDF and e-signature solutions while Adobe Experience Cloud provides products related to online marketing and analytics.Adobe\u2019s revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 (ended May 29) increased 14% Y/Y to $3.13 billion. Thanks to accelerated digital transformation amid the pandemic, the requirement for document signing, editing, and the company\u2019s other cloud products spiked significantly. The company's adjusted EPS was up 34% Y/Y to $2.45.Notably, remote working drove a sequential rise of 40% in the company\u2019s web-based PDF services and a 175% rise in the use of Adobe Sign since the start of the fiscal year. Also, mobile usage of the company\u2019s offerings jumped with Acrobat Reader installations rising 43% Y/Y in the first quarter while Adobe Scan installations increased 66% Y/Y. (See Adobe stock analysis on TipRanks)On August 12, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz reiterated a Buy rating for Adobe stock with a price target of $430. In a research note, he explained \u201cWe view Adobe as a core investment holding and believe long-term software investors will be rewarded over the coming years as the company remains an underpriced earnings and free cash flow story.\u201dOverall, Wall Street has a bullish call on Adobe with a Strong Buy consensus based on 16 Buys versus 5 Holds and no Sell ratings. Adobe stock has risen about 36% so far in 2020, and as a result, the average price target of $437.84 signifies a 2.2% downside over the next 12 months.DocuSign (DOCU)DocuSign is widely known for its e-signature solution. However, its cloud software suite includes several other processes that automate the entire agreement process. DocuSign has the first-mover advantage with an impressive market share of 69.04% (as per a Datanyze report) in the e-signature space. Rivals RightSignature, SignNow and Adobe Sign have a market share of 6.28%, 5.77%, and 5.28%, respectively.The COVID-19 led demand for DocuSign\u2019s business reflected in a 39% rise in its fiscal 2021 first quarter (which ended April 30) revenue of $297 million. Despite strong sales, the company posted loss per share of $0.26. However, the company\u2019s EPS was $0.12 excluding one-time items.The company expects the strong trend in its business to continue as its Agreement Cloud and DocuSign CLM (Contract Lifecycle Management) applications will help in capturing growth beyond digital signatures. DocuSign added over 10,000 net new direct customers and 58,000 self-service customers in the fiscal first quarter, bringing the total paying customers to 661,000.Most notably, DocuSign has tremendous opportunity in international markets, which currently account for only 18% of the revenue. It is now making strategic acquisitions to expand its product offerings. In July, DocuSign acquired Austin-based Liveoak Technologies to leverage the start-up\u2019s technology for accelerating the introduction of its DocuSign Notary product.In May, the company completed the acquisition of Seal Software\u2014a provider of contract analytics and artificial intelligence technology. DocuSign believes that Seal\u2019s AI expertise will bolster its offerings.Last month, five-star analyst Patrick Walravens raised his price target for DocuSign stock to $233 from $150 while reiterated his Buy rating. The JMP Securities analyst stated that \u201cThe core eSignature business remains an underpenetrated, high-growth business opportunity, where DocuSign has a dominant competitive position.\u201dWalravens believes that the company has major opportunities in federal, mortgages and notary services. (See DocuSign stock analysis on TipRanks)DocuSign stock has risen about 169% year-to-date. It has a consensus analyst rating of Moderate Buy based on 9 Buys and 5 Holds and no Sell recommendations. The average price target of $186.17 implies a downside of 6.8% over the next year.Adobe and DocuSign are poised for long-term growth as the convenience of their services might continue to attract customers even when the pandemic abates. However, DocuSign has not yet turned profitable due to its growth investments. Moreover, growth prospects look fully priced in the company\u2019s stock.Adobe appears to be the more favorable choice based on its diverse businesses and the analyst consensus rating.To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

Some Silicon Valley startups, hungry for young talent, see it as an opportunity.Over the past few months, several companies have presented an alternative to school: a remote internship, aimed specifically\u00a0at young people looking for alternatives to a dismal school year.Dozens of Silicon Valley startups are looking to hire fall interns, according to a list assembled\u00a0by\u00a0startup accelerator Y Combinator. This month, venture firm Neo organized a virtual career fair for 120 students and a range of startups, hoping to match pairs for internships during the upcoming academic year. And venture firm Contrary Capital is offering to invest $100,000 in\u00a0five teams of entrepreneurs if they\u00a0take a gap year from school to build a company.\u00a0Such arrangements allow interns to get paid and learn on the job, while avoiding paying tens of thousands of dollars for Zoom University. It also means that companies willing to improvise on hiring\u00a0and gamble on younger workers\u00a0may get new access to fresh talent. Ali Partovi, Neo\u2019s chief executive officer,\u00a0said the firm surveyed 120 students who are part of its mentorship programs and found that 46% of them\u00a0are\u00a0interested in taking a gap semester\u00a0and\u00a021% are interested in taking a gap year.\u201cThere's a potential for a big shift right now,\u201d said Alexandr Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Scale AI Inc., a startup that helps people train computer vision. He said Scale\u00a0would hire up to 10 gap-year workers if they found the right people.\u00a0For many students he talks to, school this year seems\u00a0like a\u00a0\u201csub-optimal\u201d option, Wang said.Companies have varying approaches to what gap year hiring would look like. Food-delivery service Postmates Inc. said it\u2019s considering\u00a0extending the tenure of the summer interns in its robot-delivery team to allow for those who want to take time off school. And Lumos, a six-person web security startup, is offering around $80,000 to four full-time \u201cfellows\u201d to work on different projects during the academic year.\u00a0Students, meanwhile, are trying to make sense of a dizzying array of choices, as on-campus options lose their appeal. \u201cEveryone is uncertain,\u201d said Evani Radiya-Dixit, a rising\u00a0senior at Stanford University who is considering taking a gap year, and who recently interned at X, Alphabet Inc.'s research and development lab. Stanford made it even more confusing last week, when it abruptly announced that it was ending most on-campus housing for students for the fall quarter. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say Stanford is going to be like a prison,\u201d said Victor Cardenas, a Stanford sophomore and computer science major, now debating taking time off to build\u00a0a company.\u00a0\u201cYou're only allowed to be in your dorm, and someone not in your dorm can't be there. You have to eat 6 feet away from everyone.\u201dStartups are particularly well-positioned to capitalize on Covid-19 campus jitters. Bigger companies often don't want to take on the legal hassles of bringing on students beyond regimented internship programs, said Scale\u2019s Wang, who is 23 and has been working in tech since he dropped out of college.\u201cA\u00a0lot of students are thinking about it, and hopefully a lot of companies are willing to take a risk on these students,\u201d Wang said. \u201cIf you'd hire them a year from now, you should be willing to hire them now.\u201dNimbler startups willing to experiment could gain access to star students who might otherwise have wound up in summer jobs at giants like Facebook Inc., Alphabet\u00a0or Apple Inc., managers say. \u201cUsually you would fight to get on the radar with people, and here people are reaching out,\u201d said Emmanuel Straschnov, the co-CEO of Bubble, an\u00a0app design service. Compared with regular recruiting, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s like night and day.\u201d\u00a0The ultimate payoff isn\u2019t just the student labor. \u201cWith recruiting you always play the long game,\u201d said Nick Schrock, CEO of Elementl, a developer tools startup that\u2019s planning to hire three gap-year workers this fall. \u201cA\u00a0great intern who has a great network can often yield compounded returns later down the line.\u201dStudents are assessing the trade-offs critically, and\u00a0trying to decide if what they\u2019re getting from schools is worth the cost, especially if classes happen virtually. Levi Villarreal, who will be a senior at University of Texas at Austin, pays his own tuition. Luckily as a Texas native it\u2019s relatively inexpensive, but he\u2019s still weighing his options. Villarreal has previously interned at Adobe Inc.\u00a0and Google, and had been looking forward\u00a0to living in New York City for his internship this summer.

As far as stocks go, Wayfair (NYSE:W) is not one of my favorites. DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), on the other hand, has the makings of a 10-bagger. That's why I recently included DocuSign stock amongst a group of 7 Hot Stocks to Stay Hot for Years to Come.    Source: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.com As an interesting aside, I also included Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) and Livongo Health (NASDAQ:LVGO) on this list; They just announced an $18.5 billion marriage. But I digress. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWayfair's stock is up 242.1% year to date through Aug. 11. When I suggested investors take profits in late May, it was only trading around $154, so if you listened to my advice, you missed out on $150 in further gains. My bad.  In my defense, I did suggest that I would be far more amenable to the stock if it were to make a profit. Well, it did just that in the second quarter, generating a GAAP profit (yes, you read that right) of $273.9 million on $2 billion in net revenue.If I thought that Wayfair's remarkable quarter was the result of incredible business execution or a spectacular product offering, I might be persuaded to consider its stock for the long haul. Alas, the novel coronavirus has made Wayfair's management look like geniuses. It won't last. The only way I see this being permanent is if the new customers it gained during Covid-19 return for more once a vaccine has inoculated the entire country and brick-and-mortar retail returns to something closer to normal.I see the customers DocuSign's gained during Covid-19 as being far more \"sticky\" than Wayfair's. Here's why. What's DocuSign Gained?As I stated in my July article about hot stocks that will stay hot, I pointed out that DocuSign is building a business that will be vital to the success of companies working from home.   * 8 Cheap Stocks to Keep on Your Short List \"The company announced in the first quarter that it had almost 661,000 paying customers for products such as its eSignature digital signature and many others. As more companies move to a permanent work-from-home workforce, Docusign's going to be a significant beneficiary of that transformation,\" I wrote on Jul. 9. Not only do products such as eSignature make things easier for businesses to do business virtually, but the company is building a modern-day equivalent of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).I get venture capitalist Fred Wilson's daily blog post in my email every day. I like his stuff because he keeps the number of words to a minimum and, more importantly, on the subject. He's a must-read. Anyway, in his Aug. 12 message, he discusses his frustration with subscription agreements, lamenting the fact that despite all the technological advances in the past six-and-a-half years, he still has to fill them out. \"One great thing has happened on this issue in those six and a half years. Many/most subscription agreements are now sent digitally via DocuSign or Adobe,\" Wilson writes. \"That's great. It is certainly a bit easier to complete them online and once you have done that, there is no need to scan and email.\"During Covid-19, businesses and business people have found ways to keep transacting business while working virtually from home or wherever they've chosen to hang their hats. Companies like DocuSign are providing the tools to make this a permanent situation. More importantly, any time you have a business that makes or saves people time and money, you've got a winning formula. Wayfair, on the other hand, is just another online retailer. It doesn't sell anything particularly unique. It's certainly not going to make you any money unless, of course, you bought its stock, but it does have those kitschy Kelly Clarkson ads.  In 10 years, I would be shocked if Wayfair is making more money than DocuSign.  The Bottom Line on DocuSign StockI've written for InvestorPlace going on nine years. In all that time, I've only written about DocuSign stock on two occasions. Both were in the past two months, both because of the company's contribution to a post-Covid society. As I said in June, DocuSign is an innovative stock to buy in the new normal. Wayfair, not so much. Will Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

But while it is a solid step in the right direction, the smartphone giant needs to do far more to change the game.Bloomberg News reported Thursday that Apple is preparing to launch several bundles, internally named \u201cApple One,\u201d as soon as October. There will be multiple tiers \u2014\u00a0including a low-end package with Apple Music and Apple TV+, along with higher-end offerings that incorporate its Apple Arcade gaming service, Apple News+ and more iCloud storage. Further, the company is developing a new virtual fitness-class subscription\u00a0that will compete with offerings from Peloton Interactive Inc. and Nike Inc.Wall Street has been clamoring for years for Apple to do more on subscription bundles, citing the success of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Prime service. Although these bundles seem like a decent start at first blush, they are too incremental and tentative. The problem is, with the exception of Apple Music, none of these other subscriptions have gained much traction with the general public. So\u00a0the bundles are essentially just a\u00a0price reduction for Apple\u2019s current array of mixed and generally underperforming\u00a0products.\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman reported that they will work with Apple\u2019s Family Sharing system and could save customers $2 to $5 a month in the aggregate compared with current pricing.So, what should Apple do instead? The company needs to be much bolder. At a bare minimum, Apple should combine its hardware and software products\u00a0into a larger monthly subscription. Already, Apple has its\u00a0iPhone Upgrade Program, which\u00a0enables\u00a0annual smartphone upgrades and includes the AppleCare+ service. Combining this offering with the new subscription bundles\u00a0is a no-brainer.In addition, Apple needs to follow the lead of its\u00a0two other giant tech competitors. For example, Amazon\u2019s Prime\u00a0offers dozens of\u00a0disparate\u00a0features and consumer benefits\u00a0from fast shipping, music, books and\u00a0video to exclusive deals and discounts. And Microsoft Inc. has added similar deals in\u00a0its latest 365 subscription plans, which now include additional free promotions worth hundreds of dollars from outside software and app makers like Adobe Inc. There is no reason Apple can\u2019t do similar things.Frankly, it\u2019s befuddling that Apple hasn\u2019t taken advantage of its biggest asset \u2014\u00a0an avid, passionate base of more than a billion active customers. The tech giant should expand aggressively into financial services, commerce and retail, either by creating its own services or partnering with other\u00a0companies. With the power of its huge scale, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to add a larger array of discounts and promotions, too.And nothing would engender more loyalty than creating a truly \u201cmust-have\u201d comprehensive subscription\u00a0for hardware, software\u00a0and everyday lifestyle services. An\u00a0offering that provides amazing value would be great for Apple\u2019s customers and the company\u2019s business.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.
