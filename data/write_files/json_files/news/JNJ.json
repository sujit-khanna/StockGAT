Kim Reynolds and thousands of other Trump supporters will likely defy the governor\u2019s own emergency proclamation to keep distance between people in public places. A public health emergency proclamation signed by Reynolds requires that organizers of mass gatherings \u201cmust ensure at least six feet of physical distance between each group or individual attending alone.\u201d A White House Coronavirus Task Force report on Iowa from Oct. 4 said, \u201cgroup gathering sizes should be limited.\u201d Officials at Des Moines International Airport, where the rally will be held in a cargo hangar, have been told to plan for up to 10,000 people. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said the event will be in an open-door airplane hangar, and temperature checks will be taken of all participants who will also be issued masks and instructed to wear them. Photos and reporting from a Trump rally in Florida on Monday showed little apparent social distancing efforts, and most of those at the rally didn\u2019t appear to be wearing masks. Trump, who was hospitalized with COVID-19 only a week ago, didn\u2019t wear a mask while speaking. \u201cI would say any type of rally that\u2019s going to gather large groups of people, whether it\u2019s a couple hundred or couple thousand, is one of the riskiest things we can do in the setting of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr. Megan Srinivas, an infectious disease doctor who lives in Iowa and is a faculty member of the University of North Carolina. ___ HERE\u2019S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK: \u2014 WHO: Europe reported more than 700,000 coronavirus cases last week \u2014 Dutch order bars,...", "url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/The-Latest-India-sees-its-fewest-new-cases-since-15642986.php"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 21:28:38", "title": "Vaccine expert says social distancing will be needed until next summer", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/10/13/22/34355020-0-image-a-44_1602624475475.jpg", "site": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk", "text": "Andrew Pollard, head of Oxford's Covid vaccine team, warned strict rules would have to be followed even if his global trial proved successful.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8836891/Vaccine-expert-warns-facemasks-social-distancing-needed-summer.html"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 21:06:00", "title": "Pharmaceutical, Biotech and Banking Companies Lead the Way in Social Responsibility", "image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-243697/social", "site": "wsj", "text": "Some surprising leaders sit atop the social-capital category in the WSJ\u2019s top 100 sustainably managed companies", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pharmaceutical-biotech-and-banking-companies-lead-the-way-in-social-responsibility-11602623200"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:52:25", "title": "Possible Safety Issue Spurs Pause Of COVID-19 Antibody Study", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/10/Virus_Outbreak_Antibody_Drug_62910.jpg", "site": "https://www.news18.com", "text": "Independent monitors have paused enrollment in a study testing the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir plus an experimental antibody therapy being developed by Eli Lilly thats similar to a treatment President Donald Trump recently received.", "url": "https://www.news18.com/news/lifestyle/health-and-fitness-possible-safety-issue-spurs-pause-of-covid-19-antibody-study-2961323.html"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:38:04", "title": "Possible safety issue spurs pause of COVID-19 antibody study", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_8354832346a04769bdb6c7b276b5a59b_16x9_992.jpg", "site": "abcnews", "text": "Independent monitors have paused enrollment in a study testing the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir plus an experimental antibody therapy being developed by Eli Lilly", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/safety-issue-spurs-pause-covid-19-antibody-study-73594268"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:37:39", "title": "Possible safety issue spurs pause of COVID-19 antibody study", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_8354832346a04769bdb6c7b276b5a59b_16x9_992.jpg", "site": "abcnews", "text": "Independent monitors have paused enrollment in a study testing the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir plus an experimental antibody therapy being developed by Eli Lilly", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/safety-issue-spurs-pause-covid-19-antibody-study-73594267"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:36:34", "title": "Possible safety issue spurs pause of COVID-19 antibody study", "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/8354832346a04769bdb6c7b276b5a59b/3000.jpeg", "site": "https://apnews.com", "text": "Independent monitors have paused enrollment in a study testing the COVID-19 antiviral drug remdesivir plus an experimental antibody therapy being developed by Eli Lilly that\u2019s similar to a...", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-donald-trump-infectious-diseases-338dafcdbf4d0c6d72812c1e8f88f6a5"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:25:00", "title": "Johnson & Johnson stock underperforms Tuesday when compared to competitors", "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-215079/social", "site": "marketwatch", "text": "Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson slid 2.29% to $148.36 Tuesday, on what proved to be an all-around grim trading session for the stock market, with the S&P 500...", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/johnson-johnson-stock-underperforms-tuesday-when-compared-to-competitors-01602620740"}, {"symbol": "JNJ", "publishedDate": "2020-10-13 20:20:00", "title": "Boeing Deliveries Were Terrible.
