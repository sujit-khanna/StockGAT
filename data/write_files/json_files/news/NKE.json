But that didn\u2019t stop the competing athletes from enjoying themselves on the 3.1-mile course on a brisk Saturday morning at the Bear Branch Sports Fields. The Woodlands hosts Nike South every year, bringing in dozens of teams and elite runners from around the state. This time around, the numbers were drastically reduced after the UIL dictated that only eight teams are allowed to compete at each cross country meet. \u201cI know the kids were really excited,\u201d said The Woodlands coach Juris Green, whose girls and boys teams both took first place in the varsity races. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from coaches from other schools about how excited their kids were as well when they knew they were coming here. It\u2019s not the same. It\u2019s a different course, different setup, different equipment, a little bit more of a shoestring budget this year. But the funny thing is, the excitement is still there when the kids line up.\u201d Nike South spanned two days this year, and three races were held Friday evening. The varsity races took place first thing Saturday morning and were followed by three more sub-varsity competitions. In accordance with the UIL guidelines, runners and their supporters left the park following each race to avoid large crowds. Despite those changes, Green was pleased with how everything went. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have double the numbers, or even more, but the teams that came, they were invited because they had quality, they would bring the whole house and we could fill up some races,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe kids are happy, and I think right now, from an educator\u2019s standpoint, that should be one of the first things you should do \u2014...", "url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/neighborhood/moco/sports/article/CROSS-COUNTRY-The-Woodlands-dominates-Nike-South-15618990.php"}, {"symbol": "NKE", "publishedDate": "2020-10-02 18:25:58", "title": "Nike: Book Your Profits Now, The Current Valuation Is Unreasonable (NYSE:NKE)", "image": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png", "site": "seekingalpha", "text": "Nike's stock has rallied massively over the past six months, beating the overall market by a great margin.", "url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4377376-nike-book-your-profits-now-current-valuation-is-unreasonable"}, {"symbol": "NKE", "publishedDate": "2020-10-02 15:37:23", "title": "Union LA Uses the Artwork of Sheila Bridges In Latest Converse Collaboration", "image": "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Converse_x_Union_10_original-e1601646638869.jpg", "site": "https://footwearnews.com", "text": "The collab is releasing in October.", "url": "https://footwearnews.com/2020/focus/collaborations/union-la-converse-sheila-bridges-release-info-1203062266/"}, {"symbol": "NKE", "publishedDate": "2020-10-02 14:25:36", "title": "Foot Locker: A Short-Term Way To Cheaply Own Nike (NYSE:FL)", "image": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_192-59bfd51c9fe6af025b2f9f96c807e46f8e2f06c5ae787b15bf1423e6c676d4db.png", "site": "seekingalpha", "text": "Foot Locker is booming as people spend their stimulus on sneakers.
