Long-Term Tailwinds For Home Depot: BofA Securities analyst Elizabeth Suzuki said it's not too late to buy Home Depot shares to capitalize on the shelter-in-place environment.\"Although home improvement spending in the coming quarter may decelerate amidst sequentially declining government stimulus/unemployment benefits, we believe that the longer-term tailwinds for the home improvement industry are generally favorable,\" the analyst said in a Wednesday upgrade note. Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman said Home Depot is a best-in-class home improvement investment, adding that the housing market has structural, long-term tailwinds.\"In Q3, we assume comps moderate from mid-20s in the first two weeks of August to 20% in the last two weeks of August, followed by 13% in September and 7% in October,\" the analyst said. Home Depot's Market Share Opportunity: Raymond James analyst Matthew McClintock said investors shouldn't be turned off by Home Depot's size given that the company still has meaningful market share opportunities.\"Bigger picture, we see Home Depot as the best-in-class retailer in an effective duopoly, one which should benefit from macro tailwinds for at least the balance of this year,\" the analyst said.

Target Corp., though, is among the elite players in the industry that knows what to do with a difficult pitch.\u00a0The big-box giant recorded an eye-popping 24% increase in comparable sales from a year earlier, far higher than the 9% advance\u00a0analysts had estimated and its all-time highest quarterly gain on that measure. Online sales soared 195%, including strong increases in\u00a0its drive-up and pickup options. Meanwhile, comparable sales in its brick-and-mortar stores boomed 10.9%.\u00a0Many shoppers have adapted to the Covid-19 era by gravitating toward stores where they can do one-stop shopping. In some cases, they may have been pushed in this direction initially by circumstance, when local mandates forced the closure of non-essential retailers. Others are consolidating their trips out of a preference to avoid crowds and protect their health.\u00a0That change in behavior has clearly been a boon for Target. The retailer said Wednesday that it gained market share in categories such as electronics, where sales rose more than 70% from a year earlier, and apparel, where it notched \u201cdouble-digit\u201d sales growth. It is noteworthy that Target scored that strong clothing sales growth, along with a greater-than-30% sales increase in its home goods division, in the same quarter that Kohl\u2019s Corp. \u2014\u00a0\u00a0which has\u00a0similar price points but more specialized focus \u2014\u00a0saw revenue plunge 23%.\u00a0Target\u2019s average ticket \u2014\u00a0a measure gauging the sales amount per receipt\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0rose 18.8% in the quarter, another clear sign that people are doing more big stock-up trips when they hit\u00a0up the retailer\u2019s\u00a0stores and website.\u00a0There are signs elsewhere of the shift toward consolidated shopping visits. When Home Depot Inc. reported blockbuster earnings results on Tuesday, executives said their research showed consumers\u00a0were visiting fewer and fewer retailers, and they believed that pattern was resulting in increased interest on its website in categories such as home decor and textiles.This is\u00a0not to say that Target is just passively benefiting from weird, unforeseen shifts in consumer behavior.\u00a0\u00a0It has been laying the groundwork for\u00a0the rise in e-commerce and curbside pickup\u00a0for years, enabling it to meet the\u00a0explosion in the trend amid the pandemic.\u00a0The chain has methodically been rolling out pickup counters and drive-up lanes at its stores for retrieving online orders. The idea was that this format would prove popular with consumers because it could be speedier than doorstep delivery, and it would be better for Target\u2019s bottom line than e-commerce models where it shipped packages to customers\u2019 homes.\u00a0\u00a0So when the pandemic brought on a crush of interest in drive-up and pickup orders as people tried to stay away from stores but wanted goods quickly, Target was relatively well-positioned to respond.\u00a0Target said it added 10 million new digital customers in the first half of the year.\u00a0\u00a0If it can make habitual shoppers out of even a fraction of those people, that bodes well for the long-term health of its e-commerce business.\u00a0Target also has invested heavily in sprucing up its apparel and home offerings to make them more trendy, positioning that had already made it a credible challenger to the likes of Macy\u2019s Inc. or TJX Cos.\u00a0\u00a0That work certainly helped drive its sales growth in the quarter, as customers who might have needed to visit Target\u00a0for household essentials would have seen a well-curated and well-designed selection of goods in these more\u00a0discretionary categories.In a testament to the resilience of Target\u2019s model, it managed to increase its gross margin in the quarter to 30.9% even as it plowed money into increased labor expenses necessitated by the demands of the pandemic. Target\u2019s\u00a0booming sales \u2014\u00a0and its ability to keep a lid on discounting \u2014\u00a0\u00a0were enough to offset that challenge to profitability.\u00a0The pandemic has had a dramatic effect on major retailers, revealing the weak to be even more vulnerable than before\u00a0and making the dominant\u00a0ones appear even more untouchable. Target is certainly in the latter category, with this moment of massive upheaval serving to fortify, and even increase, its market share.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

Walmart's Sam's Club also saw a 60% increase in new members in the quarter, as America looks for bargains during the fiscal uncertainty of COVID. Home Depot also saw a massive increase in demand, with same-store sales in the second quarter up 23.4%, and the average ticket up 10.1%.

Nice rally, but the SPX finished a few points shy of the record closing level of 3386. Some say the market might need a new catalyst to close above the old record. Well, this morning could have brought that in the form of very solid earnings from two of the biggest U.S. retailers--Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT) and Home Depot Inc (NYSE: HD). It looks like we'll have an opportunity here and the market could flirt with that record high at the open. A new high close for the SPX--if it happens--is always meaningful. However, some might say that's a little less true this time because part of it remains, where else can people go to put their money? Low rates and lack of yield anywhere else has steered many people into stocks, which probably isn't news to anyone after all this time.The \"new-high\" media coverage has been breathless, but is it warranted? After all, the SPX is just a number. For many, the larger issue is what a new high in the broad-based benchmark says about the state of the recovery, investor sentiment, and the look ahead to what will hopefully be greener pastures in 2021. Will we get there this week? Perhaps, but then what? Obviously, people are trading thousands of different stocks, not just the index, but caution could be creeping in at a higher level as the SPX approaches this area up around 3390, after bottoming below 2200 intraday less than five months ago.  That didn't stop the Nasdaq (COMP) from notching another record high on Monday--its 33rd of 2020. With headlines focused on record highs, some investors might be worried about whether things have come too far, too fast. As we noted yesterday, a few technical indicators point toward overbought conditions.And then there are fundamentals. We might need a new fundamental catalyst to take things higher with earnings season just about over. Walmart, Home Depot Bring Home the Q2 Bacon WMT just crushed it, with earnings and revenue that easily topped Wall Street's expectations. One really amazing aspect of WMT's earnings came on the e-commerce side, which nearly doubled with a meteoric 97% rise in the U.S. during the quarter. U.S. same-store sales rose 9.3%, a huge amount for a company that's so well established.All this points to WMT handling the crisis very well with its online capabilities, curbside pickup, supply chain strategy, and product mix. It also might have benefited from being considered an \"essential\" business that was allowed to keep its doors open during the worst of the pandemic. The solid WMT quarter also might reinforce ideas that consumers weren't all in dire shape in Q2, despite so many people suffering job losses. The question is how the rest of the year might shape up for WMT and other big-box stores. WMT didn't offer guidance, and that might be why shares pulled back a bit after initially rocketing higher in pre-market trading. Their call is probably the place to check for investors who want to hear more about the outlook for retail.Home Depot (HD) was the other big retailer with impressive earnings this morning, and in its case, investors rewarded shares with 2% pre-market gains. Earnings and revenue easily exceeded the Street's expectations, and U.S. same-store sales rose an astonishing 25%. People have time--that's what it comes down to. People had an extra hour in their days thanks to not commuting, so it looks like they used it to start all those home projects they'd been putting off. Once earnings are out of the way, the \"dog days of summer\" could help volatility continue its retreat. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) has been tiptoeing toward the 20 mark in recent weeks,  edging its way down as company news goes into a lull. It recently traded below 21.5, a level it last saw in February (see chart below). That being said, an absence of corporate and Fed news could leave more space for geopolitical noise to get peoples' attention.An Earnings Post-Mortem, and a Look at 2021 Optimism Earnings were better than expected in Q2, with about 83% of companies reporting a positive surprise, according to research firm FactSet. Still, the forward price-to-earnings ratios are out of whack vs. historic norms for just about every sector. This could be explained partly by the current low interest rates and the Fed's reluctance to raise them for what looks like years ahead. It also might be based on ideas that things could get better in 2021 as vaccines potentially come into use, though there's no certainty there, of course. A lot of analysts have basically washed their hands of 2020 earnings and have their eyes on next year's possible results. For calendar year 2021, analysts predict S&P 500 earnings growth of 26.5%, according to FactSet. If that's the case (and we're a long way from finding out) it could potentially help push valuations closer to what people are used to. However, it's not likely to take the P/E down too much. Right now, the forward 12-month price-to-earnings level is around 22, vs. the historic average of 15, FactSet noted. Even if 2021 earnings grow by FactSet's predicted 26%, P/E would be around 18, based on where the SPX is now. And that's if the SPX spends the next year marching in place, which investors know seldom happens. Long story short: It looks like the SPX has done a really good job over the last six months building in an optimistic scenario. However, if things don't go well with the pandemic, or if the U.S. election sparks controversy, or if China trade relations worsen, or if a whole bunch of other things happen, those overbought technicals might start looking like they had some merit. We'll have to watch and wait, but all of this is more reason investors need to be careful about their portfolio balances and not let any particular investment area get over-stretched beyond their individual comfort levels.CHART OF THE DAY: FEBRUARY IN AUGUST? The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX--candlestock) recently traded under 22, a level last seen in February. That happens to be around the same time the S&P 500 Index (SPX--purple line) was at current levels, as well. Go figure! Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Cboe Global Markets.  Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  From Peak to Near-Peak: Tomorrow marks the six-month anniversary of the SPX posting its all-time high close of 3386. The index has been flirting with that mark the last week or so, which raises the question how did we get here? In other words, it might be helpful to look at which sub-sectors of the S&P performed best since the pre-pandemic high, and which did worst.It probably won't shock anyone to hear that over the last six months, the best two S&P 500 sub-sectors were Internet Retail (up 40.4%) and Technology/Hardware/Storage (up 36.6%). Companies in the gold business also did just fine in these times of concern, rising 36.1%. Air Freight & Logistics and Interactive Home Entertainment rounded out the top five, according to research firm CFRA. The worst performers included a 58.6% drop for Oil and Gas Drilling, and a 53% decline for Department stores. The department store sector comes into the spotlight this week as many retailers report earnings, so we'll see if the hard times continued as reopening got underway across much of the economy. Mortgage REITS, Textiles, and Airlines were the other worst-performing sub-sectors since February.Networking Opportunity? NVDA About to Report: Any list of the year's top performers so far has to include the semiconductor space, and few companies have done as well in the market as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the company--expected to report tomorrow after the close--were up 107% year-to-date as of earlier this week. In one sense, it's switched places with competitor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). Shares of AMD aren't exactly stragglers, of course, up 79% so far this year. However, last year it was AMD that went up triple-digits while NVDA investors had to settle for a mere double-digit gain.Basically, these and other chip stocks continue to benefit from people working at home. That includes many peoples' kids, stuck doing school remotely now that the academic year is underway.  This raises the need for data, web services, and internet storage. A lot of other things are contributing to NVDA's market success, including excitement about the recent closing of an acquisition that analysts believe might help its networking capabilities and troubles at competitor Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). The company is also known as a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) business. GPUs are specialized electronic circuits used extensively by the video game industry and in some business applications.Caution Flag: One thing to keep in mind heading into NVDA earnings--something you often see for any company that's been going gangbusters in the market--is that any kind of miss, either on earnings and revenue or in a specific business area, might set NVDA shares up for some softness. The market is basically pricing in perfection from this company and the sector in general, and you can see how investors punish firms that don't meet expectations (check out INTC's plunge last month after earnings). If you've owned NVDA during this amazing rally, good for you. Just understand that although the company is doing well, the share price also reflects optimism for the future in a sector that's had its ups and downs lately.

And yet, even as the mega-retailer unveiled\u00a0another\u00a0strong quarterly performance, the underpinnings of its\u00a0results should serve as a wake-up call to Washington: More government stimulus is urgently needed\u00a0because it was crucial to keeping consumers off the sidelines this summer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walmart\u00a0 reported Tuesday that U.S. comparable sales rose 9.3% from a year earlier in the period ended\u00a0July 31, far surpassing analysts\u2019 estimates. The growth was powered by its e-commerce division, where sales jumped 97% from a year earlier, with both pickup and delivery options notching all-time high sales volumes. The robust\u00a0growth also reflected a 27% increase in average ticket, or the total bill, as people consolidated their shopping into fewer trips.\u00a0\u00a0While Walmart continued to see healthy growth in its grocery segment, an important component of its battle with Amazon.com Inc,\u00a0\u00a0its strongest sales increases\u00a0in the U.S. division were\u00a0in general merchandise, with shoppers shelling out for sporting goods, gardening gear and electronics. Home Depot Inc. also appeared to benefit from consumers sprucing up their houses and yards, reporting a blockbuster 23% increase in comparable sales in the quarter. But at Walmart, even clothing \u2013 which generally has been one of the bleakest categories\u00a0in the retail industry \u2013\u00a0\u00a0saw increased sales.\u00a0\u00a0In earnings materials, Walmart cited the importance of government stimulus multiple times, saying it buoyed results at both its namesake stores and its Sam\u2019s Club chain. The company said that consumers having that money in their wallets helped power sales in high-margin general-merchandise categories, meaning it supported both revenue growth and profitability. The company said \u201cas stimulus funds tapered off, sales started to normalize.\u201d For Walmart, \u201cnormalizing\u201d still made for quite healthy business; executives said U.S. comparable sales were up 4% in July.\u00a0But the implications here should be crystal clear. With soaring unemployment and the pandemic nowhere near under control, stimulus money was essential to keeping spending from drying up, and thus to keeping the bottom from falling out of the economy.\u00a0Walmart deserves credit for managing well through a time of extreme volatility. This is evident in the fact that it managed to deliver an increase in gross margin in the quarter even as it fulfilled far more online orders. Walmart will likely continue to hold up reasonably well as long as this public health crisis remains. Household essentials and groceries will continue to be in high demand while\u00a0people are stuck at home. The retailer also typically is fairly resilient in a recession, given that it is known for low prices.\u00a0\u00a0But the pattern that it described \u2013 of consumers splurging in the early months of the quarter when they had stimulus money in hand, and retreating later \u2013 could be devastating for retailers that are more concentrated in discretionary categories such as apparel. Kohl\u2019s Corp., for example, reported Tuesday that revenue fell 23% in the quarter from a year earlier. I shudder to think what its back-to-school and holiday results could look like if unemployment remains elevated and consumers don\u2019t soon get some relief.\u00a0\u00a0Walmart showed its operational and merchandising might in the quarter. But I hope Washington sees the results for what they are: a blaring alarm that it\u00a0needs to do more to keep consumers afloat.\u00a0\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Sarah Halzack is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the consumer and retail industries.

That compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 1.25 million and followed an upwardly revised 1.22 million in June.Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, increased 18.8%, the most since January 1990. The 1.5 million rate of permits topped the median estimate for 1.33 million and is now above the February pre-pandemic rate. An S&P homebuilders index rose in early trade, while the broader S&P 500 also improved on optimism about the economy.The housing market has been a bright spot for the economic recovery as low mortgage rates help make buying a home more affordable. The latest data highlight that rebound, while more recent figures suggest the trend will continue, with a measure of homebuilder sentiment jumping in August to match the highest on record.\u201cRecord low mortgage rates and demand from families looking for more space is fueling the market and is more than offsetting the downward influence of labor market turmoil,\u201d Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, Inc., said in a note.The government report Tuesday showed single-family starts rose to a 940,000 annualized rate, the fastest since February. Multifamily starts, a category that tends to be volatile and includes apartment buildings and condominiums, surged 58.4% to a 556,000 pace. The monthly increase was the largest since January 2011.Single-family permits increased 17% to a 983,000 rate, the strongest since February. The number of residential projects authorized but not yet started also advanced, to 101,000 in July, the biggest backlog since the end of 2018.The resilient housing market and stronger home improvement spending was evident in Home Depot Inc.\u2019s latest results. The retailer reported sales growth that was double expectations, prompting Chief Executive Officer Craig Menear to call the performance \u201crecord-breaking.\u201dAt the same time, builders may face some headwinds in the coming months as building costs increase. Lumber prices are at the highest on record and may keep climbing given millions of tiny beetles are destroying the world\u2019s timber supplies. The beetles have already destroyed 15 years of log supplies in British Columbia, enough trees to build 9 million single-family homes.The government\u2019s report showed starts rose in all four regions. In the South, new construction was the strongest since February, while starts in the Midwest improved to their best pace of the year.(Adds homebuilder shares)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-starts-u-surged-july-123557900.html"}, {"symbol": "HD", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:37:00", "title": "Stocks Rise on Housing Strength, Home Depot and Walmart Earnings Beats", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Stocks rise modestly on strength in the U.S. housing market and earnings beats from Home Depot and Walmart.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5e76de48-a664-3267-8bbc-d98e5c98c4d4/stocks-rise-on-housing.html"}, {"symbol": "HD", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:10:00", "title": "Home Depot\u2019s Results Show Home Improvement Demand Is Still Red-Hot", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Revenue rose 23.4% as the pandemic encouraged people to upgrade their living spaces and home offices.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/525a36f3-ee76-3fb2-bdd9-53dcdf0ab3da/home-depot%E2%80%99s-results-show.html"}, {"symbol": "HD", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:04:25", "title": "Nasdaq hits all-time high at open; S&P 500 just shy of record level", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-set-stronger-open-130425116.html"}, {"symbol": "HD", "publishedDate": "2020-08-18 13:03:27", "title": "Home Depot posts record sales as demand for DIY products surges", "image": "", "site": "Yahoo", "text": "Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc  have been among a handful of corporate winners since the start of the pandemic, as more people took up do-it-yourself projects such as painting and gardening while at home.

Please check back next week for our latest earnings picks.Earnings season essentially wraps up next week -- and it's been a fruitful stretch for the market. Since April 14, when JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) reported, U.S. stocks have rallied nicely.Over the seven-plus weeks, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P; 500 have gained right around 15%. The NASDAQ Composite has done even better: a 20% bounce leaves the index just over 1% off all-time highs.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBut as we've noted in this space before, earnings reports don't necessarily seem to be the core driver. We've seen a few big post-earnings moves: Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to the upside, HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to the downside. For the most part, however, post-earnings volatility has been rather light. It seems like investors -- with only a few exceptions -- are looking past Q1 and Q2 to the second half and beyond.It seems unlikely next week will be any different, but one last burst of earnings reports are worth watching. There's still a great deal of uncertainty in the market, and no shortage of skeptics who believe the rally since March has gone too far.  * 7 Hotel Stocks to Buy Before Vacationing Restarts Even if reports don't move the market, the earnings calendar might signal whether there's any weakening of investor sentiment. That's particularly true given a healthy cross-section of companies with earnings next week. They are:  * Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX)  * Brown-Forman (NYSE:BF.A,NYSE:BF.B)  * Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE)  * GameStop (NYSE:GME)  * Chewy (NYSE:CHWY)  * Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  * Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU)So, let's dive into the earnings reports to watch next week. Earnings Reports to Watch: Stitch Fix (SFIX)Source: Sharaf Maksumov / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Monday, June 8, after market closeFor Stitch Fix, the response to the fiscal third-quarter report on Monday afternoon hopefully will be better than the sentiment that greeted the Q2 release in March. In just eight sessions since that release, SFIX stock lost nearly half its value. That included a 25% decline the day after the Q2 release, which appeared to call the company's growth story into question.As broad markets have recovered, so has SFIX. Shares now are down less than 1% year-to-date. And that bounce sets up a key report for the stock.After all, the 100%-plus rally from the lows is based at least on part on hopes that e-commerce will benefit from changes in consumer behavior. Stitch Fix, at least in theory, should be able to capitalize. And as a result, investors no doubt are expecting increased full-year guidance backed by new customers acquired during the response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Anything less may see drive a repeat of post-Q2 trading, at least in kind if not degree.That rally also makes SFIX stock a bit of an interesting test, particularly in combination with another company with earnings next week. Investors have bid up all kinds of e-commerce stocks on the thesis that consumer behavior will change for good going forward. Stitch Fix earnings might show whether that thesis is true, and the response from the market might show how much of that good news is yet to be priced in. Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B)Source: monticello / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 9, before market openAlcohol stocks like Brown-Forman, best known as the maker of Jack Daniel's, mostly haven't recovered their losses. Brown-Forman, Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ,NYSE:STZ.B), and Diageo (NYSE:DEO) all remain down in the range of 10% from February highs. Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) and Molson Coors (NYSE:TAP) have done worse. The exception has been Samuel Adams brewer Boston Beer (NYSE:SAM). SAM stock has soared, even with a recent pullback, thanks largely due to optimism toward its hard seltzer offerings.That trading makes Brown-Forman's Q4 report on Tuesday morning important for the entire sector. There's been a split in performance for the industry as whole. On-premise sales at bars and restaurants unsurprisingly have plunged, while takeaway sales have spiked (pardon the pun).  * 3 Chinese Stocks to Buy As Emerging Markets Heat Up Brown-Forman is the first major player to report earnings as some states (and countries) are starting to reopen. And so investors will get the first read on how both channels are performing as some semblance of normalcy returns. That data will move Brown-Forman stock on Tuesday, but it's going to have an impact on the rest of the sector as well. Five Below (FIVE)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 9, after market closeThere may not be much news from Five Below on Tuesday afternoon. Many of the company's stores were closed for much of the fiscal first quarter. And unlike some other retailers, Five Below doesn't have a balance sheet problem: it closed its fiscal year with no debt and well over $200 million in cash.The long-term story here should remain intact. Indeed, Five Below is acting as such. The company said last week that it still plans to open 60 to 80 new stores over the rest of the year.However, for the rest of the market, Five Below earnings reports still are worth paying attention to. This is one of the better companies in retail at the moment, and its color on recent trends will be valuable.And here, too, the response to the stock will be interesting. FIVE is down 14% so far this year, but seems like a prime candidate for buying by investors betting that normalcy will return -- for good -- in the next twelve months or so. If FIVE catches a bid on Wednesday, other strong stories across the market may have further to rally as well. GameStop (GME)Source: Shutterstock Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 9, after market closeGameStop took some of the importance out of Tuesday's report by releasing preliminary figures on Thursday afternoon. The company expects fiscal first quarter revenue to drop by about one-third, with Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) reversing to a loss from a profit the year before.The initial reaction has been negative, as GME stock fell about 8% in after-hours trading. It remains to be seen if that decline holds, or if management can reverse sentiment on next week's conference call.  * The 7 Most Bought ETFs Since the Market Bottomed GME remains a battleground stock, and it's been mostly a draw since February. GameStop still has the balance sheet to fund a turnaround, but its executives will need to convince investors that it has the strategy as well -- especially in whatever the \"new normal\" turns out to be. Chewy (CHWY)Source: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Tuesday, June 9, after market closeCHWY stock has rallied 35% since the company's fiscal fourth-quarter release in early April firmly established the company as a \"stay-at-home\" beneficiary. That includes a 17% gain just in the last six trading days.As with SFIX, expectations seem to be rising ahead of earnings next week. And an earnings report this week might provide a road map for what to expect from CHWY.Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) likely has been the biggest pandemic winner in the market this year. Shares have tripled YTD, with the company adding more than $35 billion in market capitalization.Zoom delivered a literally historic earnings beat this week. And yet, after a 6% decline on Thursday, the stock is down just 1% from pre-earnings levels.It wouldn't be stunning to see something of a repeat from Chewy. Q1 results are likely to be spectacular in terms of revenue and customer acquisition. But this is a low-margin online retailer trading at almost 4 times sales. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) loom as potential competitors. As post-earnings trading in ZM shows, it's possible that even a blowout report is priced in, or close. Adobe (ADBE)Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 11, after market closeTwo of the country's best companies report earnings next week -- both with share prices essentially at all-time highs.Adobe's fiscal second quarter release seems like a pure test for the market. Its results almost certainly will top analyst expectations: the company hasn't missed on either line since 2016. Growth will be impressive, because Adobe consistently delivers impressive growth.That said, this is a $190 billion company whose shares have rallied around 35% just since March (even excluding a brief, steep dip during the worst of the broad market selloff). ADBE stock now trades at nearly 40 times forward earnings estimates.  * 7 Retail Stocks to Buy as Businesses Reopen The broad question in tech, in particular, is not whether the sector's outlook is promising, but to what extent that potential is priced in. ADBE is a perfect encapsulation of that debate. How investors react to what should be an excellent release will be a signal as to where sentiment toward large-cap tech stands at the moment. Lululemon Athletica (LULU)Source: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.com Earnings Report Date: Thursday, June 11, after market closeOn the other hand, Lululemon Athletica earnings report are hardly a test for its industry because the company remains such a dramatic outlier.
