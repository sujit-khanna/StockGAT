The safety profile was also consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies.Professor Caicun Zhou, Head of Department of Oncology, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, stated: \u201cWe are pleased to see that sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy has met predefined primary endpoint in ORIENT-12 study. There still exists large unmet medical needs in squamous NSCLC patients. Globally, ORIENT-12 has demonstrated for the first time survival benefit by treatment with PD-1 inhibitor in combination with gemcitabine and platinum in first-line squamous NSCLC.\u201dLung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in\u00a0China. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80-85% of all lung cancer diagnosis- and about 35% of patients with NSCLC in\u00a0China\u00a0are of squamous subtype without driver genes.TYVYT (sintilimab injection), is being jointly developed in\u00a0China\u00a0by Lilly and Innovent, and has already been granted marketing approval by the NMPA for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic chemotherapy.It is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1/ PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells.Shares in LLY are up 15% year-to-date and analysts have a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy consensus on the stock\u2019s outlook.

The median overall survival (OS) was not reached in both groups, but OS showed an improvement favoring the sintilimab combination. Confirmed objective response rate was improved from 29.8% to 51.9%, and the\u00a0sintilimab combination showed a shorter time to response (1.51 months vs 2.63 months for the\u00a0placebo combination).The safety profile was consistent with previously reported sintilimab studies, and no new safety signals were identified.National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) of China has accepted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for this indication.Dr.\u00a0Li Wang, Senior VP of\u00a0Lilly China, stated: \u201cWith these encouraging results of ORIENT-11, sintilimab may soon be able to expand its indication to the first-line treatment of non-squamous NSCLC. We look forward to its potential\u00a0approval in\u00a0China, with the goal of helping more patients with lung cancer and giving these patients and their families hope of a longer life.\u201dIndeed, lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest morbidity and mortality in\u00a0China. NSCLC accounts for about 80 to 85% of lung cancer. About 70% of NSCLC in\u00a0China\u00a0is the nonsquamous subtype and 50% of nsqNSCLC is without sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements.
